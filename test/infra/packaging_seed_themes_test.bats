# The PACKAGED install doors and the built-in theme gallery (#1167).
#
# #435 taught the orchestrated deploy paths to seed the curated built-in
# themes; the packaged doors were never wired. A `.deb`/`.rpm` or AUR install
# ran the migrator and stopped, so the operator got a working bouncer with an
# EMPTY theme gallery — the palettes ship compiled into the release, but the
# gallery reads the DB and nothing ever turned the compiled data into rows.
# The wallpapers were never the missing part: the package simply did not
# finish installing itself.
#
# Scope: the three packaged doors' DECISION — that each one reaches the
# seeder, in the only order that helps (schema before data), and what it does
# when the seed fails. The release is a recorder stub that logs every
# invocation, so the assertions read what the RELEASE would actually have
# seen, not what the source text looks like.
#
# The scriptlets address the host by ABSOLUTE path (/usr/bin/grappa,
# /etc/grappa, /var/lib/grappa), so each is copied into a sandbox with those
# prefixes re-rooted. `assert_rerooted` then proves the rewrite was TOTAL: a
# leaked absolute path would either abort the run as non-root or, worse, touch
# the real host — and a harness that half-runs the script would let every
# assertion below hold for the wrong reason.
#
# The fatal/non-fatal split is the property that most wants pinning:
#   * a failed MIGRATE aborts the package transaction (a half-applied schema
#     is a correctness defect);
#   * a failed SEED is LOUD but non-fatal, carrying its retry command — the
#     posture deploy_common has held for every substrate since #440
#     (docs/OPERATIONS.md: "A seed failure WARNS and continues"). Inverting
#     it would let a cosmetic gallery failure fail an install.
