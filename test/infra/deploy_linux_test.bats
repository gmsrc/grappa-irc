#
# Characterization suite for infra/linux/deploy.sh — the native-systemd
# deploy orchestrator's DECISION logic, LOCKED before the #503 extraction
# of the shared deploy lib (infra/lib/deploy_common.sh). These tests
# capture the CURRENT behavior that the extraction must preserve:
# preflight range base (marker vs pre-pull HEAD), the marker-shape guard,
# the re-exec guard's range, the hot reload-honesty check, and the cold
# path's step ordering.
#
# Scope: pure shell-side logic, mirroring test/infra/deploy_jail_test.bats.
# The script runs against a throwaway git clone (REPO_ROOT) pulled from a
# throwaway upstream, with `sudo`, `mix`, `curl`, `systemctl` stubbed via
# PATH and the cic_build.sh / install_systemd.sh delegates stubbed as
# committed recorders inside the temp repo. What only a real host deploy
# exercises (systemd Type=exec, the live BEAM) is out of scope.
#
# #503 enrich gains have their own RED-GREEN sections at the bottom:
# --force-* flags, the marker-gated nothing-to-do fast path, and the
# DEPLOY_PREV_SHA carry across re-exec — all now landed, bringing this
# substrate to parity with the jail.
