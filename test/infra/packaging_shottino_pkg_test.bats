#
# Bats suite for GH #1447 — shottino has its OWN package, and since slice B the
# bouncer no longer ships the client binary at all.
#
# Slice A was deliberately additive: `grappa` still shipped /usr/bin/shottino,
# both packages owned that path, and they could NOT be co-installed — so the
# standalone package was built, inspected, and kept off the release. Slice B is
# the other half of that one decision: the bouncer drops the file, the takeover
# relations become true, and the client package is published.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. Dropping the file without publishing the
# replacement would take the client away from everyone who has it today, and
# publishing without dropping would ship a pair that cannot be installed
# together. Neither half is shippable alone, which is why they are one slice.
#
# The upload derivation below survives from slice A with its polarity flipped.
# Then, a package's absence from every upload directory was the gate; now, the
# client package's OWN upload step is the property — publication is explicit,
# never a side effect of a glob widening.
#
# The other three properties are the ones that make the package a CLIENT
# package rather than a second copy of the bouncer: its own version line, one
# file, no maintainer scripts, no ERTS deps.
#
# Every derivation carries a floor — a derivation that matched nothing would
# make its assertion pass vacuously.
