# infra/packaging/credits.sh — the build's git credits payload (#1773).
#
# The credits modal needs three facts the browser cannot have: the commit sha,
# its date, and the contributor list with per-author commit counts. They are
# git facts, and the cic build runs in containers that mount ONLY ./cicchetto
# (cicchetto/vite.config.ts:30-39), so the repo root is out of reach there.
# The payload is therefore derived OUTSIDE the container by the same wrappers
# that already derive GRAPPA_VERSION, and handed in on an env var.
#
# What these cases pin, and why each one exists:
#
#   1. the PAYLOAD is exact — a wrong count or a dropped author is a lie the
#      modal would render as fact, so the assertion is a byte-for-byte compare
#      against a sandbox repo whose history this file wrote;
#   2. merges are EXCLUDED — `--no-merges`, so a merge-heavy branch does not
#      credit the merger for other people's work;
#   3. a name carrying `"` or `\` stays PARSEABLE — the payload is JSON that
#      vite parses at build time, and one unescaped quote turns the whole roll
#      into a build failure (or, worse, a truncated roll);
#   4. NO GIT is not an error — the AUR recipe builds from a release tarball
#      and Dockerfile.release .dockerignore's `.git`, so on the two RELEASE
#      substrates there is no repo to read. The script must exit 0 with an
#      honestly empty payload there, exactly as `Grappa.Version` reports the
#      bare base on its no-git path. Failing loud here would break precisely
#      the two builds that ship;
#   5. ONE LINE of output — every wrapper captures it with `$(...)` into an
#      env var, and a multi-line payload would arrive mangled;
#   6. one person gets ONE credit — `.mailmap` collapses the identities a
#      contributor has committed under, and the roll must show the collapsed
#      list rather than the same person two or three times (#1808).
#
# The sandbox repos are built here rather than measured against this checkout:
# the real history changes every commit, so a case reading it could only
# assert a shape, and a shape assertion cannot tell a correct roll from an
# empty one.

# ── #1808 — one person, one credit ──────────────────────────────────────────

# The roll used to split people across the identities they had committed
# under, because nothing had ever de-duplicated them. The cure is a root
# `.mailmap`: `git shortlog` resolves author identity through it before
# grouping, so the collapse costs no history rewrite and no change to
# credits.sh.
#
# Three cases, dying of three different causes:
#
#   * the first is a SANDBOX case and pins the CHANNEL — that credits.sh
#     still reaches the mailmap-resolved name. It goes red on `--no-mailmap`,
#     or on a reimplementation over `%an` (raw) instead of `%aN` (resolved);
#   * the second reads THIS checkout and pins the MAPPINGS — it goes red when
#     a line is removed from `.mailmap`;
#   * the third reads THIS checkout and pins the one NON-collapse: an identity
#     that merely shares an address with a mapped one must stay its own. That
#     is what a mechanical dedup gets wrong, and it is invisible once done.
