# Bats suite for infra/freebsd/deploy.sh — the jail deploy orchestrator's
# DECISION logic: preflight range base (defect #7), the nothing-to-do
# fast path vs --force-* (defect #8), the re-exec guard's range, and the
# cold path's stop synchronization call (defect #9, deploy.sh side).
#
# Scope: pure shell-side logic. The script runs against a throwaway git
# clone (REPO_ROOT) pulled from a throwaway upstream, with `su`, `mix`,
# `curl`, `service` stubbed via PATH and the jail_*.sh delegates stubbed
# as committed recorders inside the temp repo. What only a real jail
# deploy exercises (rc.subr, run_erl, the live BEAM) is out of scope —
# see the manual verification plan in the shipping commit.

# --- #1656: a failed healthcheck must not hide a dead node -------------------
#
# The 2026-08-21 v1.3.0 cold deploy exhausted the healthcheck budget and exited
# saying "healthcheck never returned 200". The fact on the ground was that the
# BEAM was GONE and production was down. Those are different emergencies and
# the script rendered them identical.
#
# The probes also HAD the diagnosis and threw it away: `/healthz` answers 503
# with a body naming the failing check (ready/repo/ets), and `curl -f` discards
# a non-2xx body.
