#
# Bats suite for GH #1630 — the `integration` workflow's Elixir dep cache
# must never carry a branch-specific build artefact, and must never share a
# key namespace with `ci.yml`'s.
#
# Both invariants are one edit away from being lost, and both fail SILENTLY.
#
# 1. CONTAMINATION. CLAUDE.md documents the class: a `_build` shared between
#    worktrees produced a red that belonged to no branch (#1170 — a
#    `Grappa.Version` compiled from another tree's `VERSION`). A CI cache is
#    that same shape at GitHub scale. The step's defence is not a cleverer
#    key, it is that nothing branch-specific is ever WRITTEN: the cache holds
#    `deps/` and the deps' beams, both a pure function of files that are
#    themselves in the key. Widening the path list to a bare `_build` would
#    restore the whole class, and nothing would go red — a run would just
#    quietly be judging artefacts compiled from another commit's source.
#
# 2. ABI. These beams are built inside `elixir:1.19-otp-28-alpine`; ci.yml's
#    are built by setup-beam on glibc ubuntu. `exqlite` and `argon2_elixir`
#    ship NIFs, and mix rebuilds a NIF on ABSENCE, not on ABI — so a restore
#    that crossed the two would hand the alpine container a glibc `.so` that
#    mix considers built and will not replace. The namespaces are disjoint by
#    construction (`-mix-` vs `-e2e-musl-mix-`) and a `restore-keys` prefix
#    added on either side could quietly bridge them.
#
# The path-list checks compare the restore step's list against the save
# step's rather than against a transcribed copy: `actions/cache/save` takes
# its own `path:`, so the two can drift apart, and a cache saved over a wider
# path than it is restored from is exactly how the app's beams would sneak
# back in.
#
# STATED LIMIT of the collision check: it compares the key strings as WRITTEN,
# with `${{ }}` unexpanded. It therefore catches the namespace being widened
# or renamed into the other's — the way a collision would actually be
# introduced — but not two literals that differ in source and coincide only
# after expansion. Expanding them would need a runner.
