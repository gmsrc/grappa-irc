  #485 — the security-header set moved off nginx into the app. This plug
  is now the SINGLE source of truth for CSP + the four sibling headers on
  every substrate (Docker single-container, the m42 bastille jail, the
  operator's own TLS front door). nginx — where it survives (jail + e2e) —
  is a dumb reverse proxy that emits none of these.

  The golden literal below started as the CSP that shipped byte-for-byte
  in the retired `infra/snippets/security-headers.conf`; #607 widened
  `media-src` to `https:` (external audio in the docked mini-player) and
  #1240 widened `img-src` the same way (cross-host images in the media
  viewer) — deliberate, pinned deviations. It is intentionally hardcoded
  here (not read from the plug) so this test PINS the plug against drift —
  a characterization contract, not a mirror.
