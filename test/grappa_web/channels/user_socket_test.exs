  @moduledoc """
  WebSocket connect-time auth (sub-task 2i + #95 + #202).

  `UserSocket.connect/3` derives its assigns from a bearer token that
  rides the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol
  (`connect_info.auth_token`), entirely OFF the WS upgrade URL:

    * `connect_info.auth_token` — the bearer Phoenix decodes from the
      `base64url.bearer.phx.<token>` subprotocol. The same UUID PK that
      `Accounts.create_session/3` returns + the REST surface consumes
      via `Authorization: Bearer ...`.
    * `Accounts.authenticate(token)` validates + bumps `last_seen_at`
      with the same 60 s threshold the REST plug uses.
    * On success: `socket.assigns.user_name` (from the User row) and
      `:current_session_id` (for future revocation hooks).
    * On any failure (missing / empty / malformed token, unknown row,
      revoked, expired): `:error` so Phoenix returns the standard
      WS rejection — distinct error strings would just leak
      enumeration info.

  #202 dropped the legacy `params["token"]` query-string fallback that
  #95 had retained for one deploy cycle: a bearer supplied only via the
  query string is now IGNORED (see the "ignores a query-string token
  entirely" regression guard below).

  Cross-user join authz at the channel layer
  (`GrappaWeb.GrappaChannel.authorize/2`) was wired in 2h against
  `socket.assigns.user_name`; this test proves the value is now
  load-bearing (alice can't join vjt's topics even with a valid
  alice token).

  # `Vhosts.record_client_source/2` swallow `:db_unavailable` precisely so it
  # could never fail a connect. What it was not is best-effort in LATENCY.
  # The call sat between authentication and `{:ok, socket}`, and Phoenix holds
  # the WebSocket upgrade open until `connect/3` returns — so a writer holding
  # the SQLite write lock made the upgrade wait the whole `busy_timeout`
  # (31 575 ms measured on one `scripts/integration.sh` run) and then DROP the
  # write it had waited for. Detaching it to `Grappa.TaskSupervisor` is what
  # makes "this can never hurt a connect" true of the clock as well as of the
  # result.
  #
  # Proven by the PROCESS the write runs in, not by a wall-clock threshold
  # (which would be flaky and would need a real 30 s lock to be honest):
  # `Phoenix.ChannelTest.connect/3` invokes `connect/3` in THIS test process,
  # so a synchronous capture reports `self()` and the `refute` fails. The
  # probe is Ecto's own `[:grappa, :repo, :query]` event — the one
  # `Grappa.DbLatency` already consumes — which fires in whichever process ran
  # the query, so there is no production seam this test could be satisfied by
  # instead of the real write.
