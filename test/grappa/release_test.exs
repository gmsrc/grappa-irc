defmodule Grappa.ReleaseTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The deploy scripts — and, since #1158, the operator CLI that ships AS
  `bin/grappa` — invoke `Grappa.Release` entry points as STRINGS
  inside `bin/grappa eval '...'`. Nothing links the two at compile time:
  rename, drop, or change the arity of a function here and every substrate
  that runs a packaged release keeps calling the old shape, failing only at
  deploy time, on the
  jail and the published image, where a shell hook's non-zero exit may be
  deliberately non-fatal (#440's seed warns and continues) — so the call
  can rot in silence.

  This closes that gap by deriving the expectation from the scripts
  themselves rather than a hand-kept list, so a future entry point is
  covered the day a deploy script starts naming it.
