  #1348 at the three doors that migrate, driven against a **live
  supervised pool on a real sqlite file** whose `schema_migrations`
  already holds the duplicated version.

  That "already holds" is the whole scenario, not set dressing. It is
  the regime CLAUDE.md marks dangerous and the one no count can see:
  both files leave the pending set, `ensure_no_duplication!([])` answers
  `:ok`, the migrate reports success, and neither file ever runs again.
  The first test here measures that emptiness directly, so the rest are
  not asserting against a scenario that quietly stopped reproducing.

  The fixture set is `priv/repo/duplicate_version_smoke/migrations` —
  two files claiming `20200101000001`, owned by this test and never
  applied to `Grappa.Repo`. See that directory's README.

  Doors, in the order a deploy meets them:

    * HOT, every substrate — `Grappa.HotReload.migrate_and_reload/2`,
      reached by `POST /admin/reload`.
    * COLD, jail — `Grappa.Release.migrate/0`.
    * COLD, docker + linux — `mix grappa.migrate`, which drives the very
      same `Grappa.Release.migrate/0`.
