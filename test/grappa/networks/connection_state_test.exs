  Tests for `Grappa.Networks.{connect/1, disconnect/2, mark_failed/2}` —
  the T32 state-transition entry points (channel-client-polish S1.2).

  Per the S1.2 boundary note: these context fns do **DB transition +
  PubSub broadcast + (for the stop-shape paths) `Session.stop_session/2`
  / explicit upstream QUIT**. They do NOT spawn Session.Server — that
  orchestration (admission + start_session) lives at the caller
  (NetworkController for `/connect`, `Bootstrap` at boot) where
  `Grappa.Admission` is already a clean dep.

  Uses `Grappa.IRCServer` (in-process TCP fake) for the QUIT-upstream
  assertion on `disconnect/2` and the live-session-termination
  assertion on `mark_failed/2`. `async: false` because
  `SessionRegistry`, `SessionSupervisor`, and `PubSub` are singletons.
