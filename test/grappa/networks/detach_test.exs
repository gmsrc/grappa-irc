defmodule Grappa.Networks.DetachTest do
  @moduledoc """
  issue 2219 — `Grappa.Networks.{detach/2, reattach/1}` and the
  attachment axis they write.

  `POST /session/networks` accretes a network; nothing took one back. The
  rail has hidden a parked network since #1985, but `$home` kept listing
  it and the credential kept everything the subject had authored, so
  "I joined the wrong network" had no answer short of `DELETE /me`.

  What these tests pin is the pair of properties the column exists for:
  a detached network stops being one of the subject's networks EVERYWHERE
  a subject-facing reader looks, and it loses NOTHING — the nick, the
  SASL user, the encrypted secrets and the autojoin set are all still
  there when it comes back. A test that only checked the first half would
  pass just as happily against an unbind, which is the verb this one is
  not.

  `async: false`: `SessionRegistry`, `SessionSupervisor` and `PubSub` are
  singletons, and the live-session arm drives all three.
