  @moduledoc """
  issue 2037 — MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT, not a regression test.

  The report has three numbers on one screen for what the operator reads as
  one quantity (`1807` in the far-behind bar, `187` + `216` in the sidebar
  pills) and the issue body says in as many words that own-authored rows
  plus the content/events split do NOT account for the `1807 - 403 = 1404`
  residual. This file measures the residual TERM BY TERM against a real
  `messages` table, so the residual stops being a guess.

  It measures the three counting doors the two surfaces reach:

    * `Scrollback.count_after/6`        — the bar (`GET …/messages/count`)
    * `Scrollback.count_after_split/6`  — the join-reply / per-message badge
    * `ReadCursor.bulk_unread_split/3`  — the `/me` cold-load badge seed

  ## Controls run FIRST and gate the print

  Nothing is printed unless BOTH controls hold, because a harness that
  mis-seeds its own fixture prints a number that describes the harness:

    * NEGATIVE — a window whose rows are all peer content, one anchor, one
      presence posture: every door must return the SAME total. A non-zero
      residual here means the fixture, not the code, is divergent.
    * POSITIVE — the same window plus K own-authored content rows: the
      residual must be EXACTLY K. A residual that is merely non-zero would
      pass a harness that is off by an unrelated term.

  Both are asserted before the first `IO.puts`. `mix test` failure IS the
  abort path: an assertion raises and the reporting block never runs.
