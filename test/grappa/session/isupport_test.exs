  Tests for `Grappa.Session.ISupport` — the per-network channel-mode
  capability table parsed from 005 RPL_ISUPPORT CHANMODES= + PREFIX=.

  Covers:
  - `default/0` — the pre-005 Bahamut/Azzurra seed (the values the
    hardcoded `@user_mode_prefixes` / `@channel_modes_with_param`
    constants used to carry).
  - `merge_isupport/2` — folds CHANMODES + PREFIX tokens off a 005
    param list into an existing capability table (unknown tokens
    ignored, absent tokens preserved).
  - `takes_param?/3` — whether a channel mode consumes an argument when
    applied with the given sign (RFC 2811 type A/B always; type C on +
    only; type D never).
  - `list_mode?/2` (#1249) — whether a channel mode is CHANMODES type A
    (a per-channel list: bans, exceptions), which the mode-set walkers
    must consume the param of but never record as a channel flag.
  - `user_prefix/2` — mode letter → sigil for per-user (membership)
    modes, or `:error` for channel-level modes.
  - `presence_mechanism/1` (#247) — MONITOR=/WATCH= token capture and
    the monitor-over-watch mechanism pick for the `/notify` arm.
