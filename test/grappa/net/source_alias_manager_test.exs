  #543 INC-5 — ref-count lifecycle + boot reconcile + arm gate. A Mox adapter
  (`Grappa.Net.SourceAliasMock`) stands in for the platform, so no real
  `ifconfig` runs. The manager is a GenServer that calls the adapter during
  `init` (arm_check) + `handle_continue` (reconcile) — before any `allow/3`
  could land — so the mock runs in GLOBAL mode (safe: the suite is fully
  serial via `max_cases: 1`).
