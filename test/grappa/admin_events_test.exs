    # Drain stale `{:session, _, _}` entries left by prior tests.
    # `AdmissionStateHelpers.reset_session_supervisor/0` is the canonical
    # purge — it walks `DynamicSupervisor.which_children/1` and calls
    # `terminate_child/2` (atomic: removes the child AND prevents
    # restart, so `:transient` workers in a `:connect_failed` respawn
    # loop are killed for good), then sweeps the Registry for any
    # leaked pids (`GenServer.stop/3` with a 2s budget per pid),
    # then polls until `Registry.count` reaches 0 (15s budget).
    #
    # Pre-fix this setup re-implemented the drain inline via
    # `Registry.select` + `Session.stop_session/2` — but that walks
    # the Registry, which can race the DynamicSupervisor's restart of
    # a `:transient` worker whose Client just crashed on
    # `:tcp_closed` (window between `whereis → nil` and the new pid
    # registering itself). The canonical helper goes through the
    # supervisor directly, sidestepping the race entirely.
    #
    # The other half of this fix is `AuthFixtures.start_session_for/2`
    # + `start_visitor_session_for/2` now register an `on_exit`
    # callback that calls `DynamicSupervisor.terminate_child/2` for
    # the spawned pid — that prevents the leak at the source so
    # this setup-time drain is empty in the steady-state case.
