defmodule Grappa.AuthFixturesTeardownTest do
  @moduledoc """
  #1551 — the teardown `Grappa.AuthFixtures` registers for every session
  it spawns must free the registry KEY, not one pid.

  `Session.Server` is `restart: :transient` and the fake `IRCServer` a
  test connects to dies with the test pid, so an abnormal Client exit at
  end-of-test is the routine case, not the exotic one. The supervisor
  restarts the child, the successor re-registers the SAME key, and a
  teardown holding the pid it spawned tears down nothing: the respawned
  session outlives the test and keeps emitting lifecycle telemetry into
  whichever suite runs next. That is the leak #1551 reported.

  The callback under test runs AFTER the test body, so no assertion
  inside the body can observe it. `ExUnit` runs `on_exit` callbacks in
  REVERSE order of registration, which is the vantage point this test
  uses: an assertion registered BEFORE the fixture spawns runs AFTER the
  fixture's own teardown, and so reads the state that teardown left
  behind. Nothing else in the suite can see that state — a leaked session
  only shows up later, as an unattributable failure in another file.
