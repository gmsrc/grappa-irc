defmodule Grappa.MuteSession do
  @moduledoc """
  Registers a process in `Grappa.SessionRegistry` under a real session
  key that accepts every `GenServer.call` into its mailbox and answers
  NONE of them — the deterministic stand-in for a `Session.Server`
  whose mailbox is too deep (or whose current callback is parked on a
  DB connection) to reply inside a caller's receive budget.

  ## Why a whole helper and not `IRCServer` (issue 2239)

  `Grappa.IRCServer` gives tests a session that is *alive but idle* —
  which is the opposite axis. Nothing in the suite could produce the
  one state that makes `Grappa.Session`'s `call_session/4` take its
  `:exit, {:timeout, _}` branch, so `{:error, :timeout}` was a
  reachable return that no test had ever observed and no caller had
  ever been asked to handle.

  A caller's budget is what it is: `Session.list_channels/2` spends the
  `call_session/3` default of 5s, so a test that drives it through this
  helper pays that wall-clock. Reach for the explicit-timeout variant
  (`list_channels/3`, 250 ms in `Grappa.LiveIntrospection`) where the
  function under test offers one.

  ## Lifecycle

  `register!/2` blocks until the registration is visible to
  `Grappa.Session.whereis/2`, so the caller never races it, and
  installs an `on_exit` that kills the process — the registry entry
  goes with it. Must be called from the test process (it uses
  `ExUnit.Callbacks.on_exit/1`).
