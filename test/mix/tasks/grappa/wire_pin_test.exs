  # #1393d — the gate behind vjt's "bump it every time" ruling.
  #
  # The rule it enforces cannot be enforced by the sibling drift gate, and
  # that is a MEASUREMENT and not an opinion: `grappa.gen_wire_types --check`
  # compares the generated artefact against its own SOURCE, so a developer who
  # adds a field and regenerates gets `in sync.` — green in exactly the case
  # to catch. The detector needs a BEFORE, and `--check` has none.
  #
  # This task supplies the BEFORE as a PIN in the tree: the shape digest and
  # the `Grappa.Protocol.version/0` it was taken at, together in one file. The
  # pair is what makes it un-greenable — you cannot refresh the digest without
  # the refresh refusing unless the number moved too.
