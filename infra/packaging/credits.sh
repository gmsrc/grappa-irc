# Sibling of version.sh, and deliberately shaped like it: the cic build runs
# in containers that mount ONLY ./cicchetto (cicchetto/vite.config.ts:30-39),
# so the repo root — and therefore git — is out of reach in there. Every
# cic-build entrypoint already derives GRAPPA_VERSION from version.sh and
# exports it before the container starts; this script is the second half of
# that same channel, for the three facts a credit roll needs and a browser
# cannot have (#1773). A `git shortlog` inside vite.config.ts would find no
# repo and bake an EMPTY roll, silently, on every containerised build.
#
# POSIX sh, NOT bash, for the same reason version.sh is: the FreeBSD jail
# build (infra/freebsd/jail_cic_build.sh) runs /bin/sh with no bash port and
# calls this to derive the payload. Always EXECUTED (never sourced), so `$0`
# locates the script.
#
# ── Why this NEVER fails, unlike the GRAPPA_VERSION throw in vite.config.ts ──
#
# Two of the launchers that must call it have no `.git` BY CONSTRUCTION, and
# both are RELEASE builds:
#
#   * infra/packaging/aur/PKGBUILD builds from the tag's source TARBALL —
#     release.yml asserts that shape outright ("tarball → no .git → bare");
#   * Dockerfile.release .dockerignore's `.git`, which is exactly why the
#     comment in it says Grappa.Version "takes its no-git path".
#
# So a hard failure on a missing repo would break precisely the two builds
# that ship. This script instead reports the absence honestly — `sha:null`,
# `date:null`, `contributors:[]` — which is the SAME posture
# `Grappa.Version.verify_build_sha/2` already takes, where a positively
# identified no-git build is `{:skip, :no_git}` and only a BROKEN snapshot is
# an error. The loud half stays where it belongs: vite still refuses to build
# when GRAPPA_CREDITS is UNSET, because that means a wrapper forgot to plumb
# it, which is the failure the throw exists to catch.
#
# Why: docs/OPERATIONS.md § "Packaging (infra/packaging/)".

	# Measured on this repo's CI, where `actions/checkout` defaults to
