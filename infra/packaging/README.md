# Grappa distro packaging (self-hosting Part 2)

Builds native Linux **`.deb`** and **`.rpm`** packages for grappa from a
`mix release` + the built cicchetto SPA, via
[nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/). The release bundles Erlang/OTP, so
the target host needs **no Elixir/mix toolchain** — install the package,
set one hostname, start the service.

This is the packaging **substrate** (`build.sh`, the FHS layout, the
maintainer scripts, the openssl secret bootstrap, the migrate command) +
its nfpm **renderers** (`.deb` and `.rpm`, selected by
`GRAPPA_PKG_FORMAT`). The substrate is format-agnostic; Arch/AUR and the
tag-driven release CI ship it too — see **Building the `.rpm`** and the
shipped list below.

## FHS layout

| Path                                   | What                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/usr/lib/grappa/`                     | the mix release (self-contained ERTS + compiled app)       |
| `/usr/lib/grappa/bin/grappa`           | the release boot script                                    |
| `/usr/bin/grappa`                      | operator CLI wrapper (sources env, drops to `grappa` user) |
| `/usr/bin/shottino`                    | terminal client (`frontends/shottino`), built from source  |
| `/usr/share/grappa/cicchetto-dist/`    | built SPA (`CIC_DIST_ROOT`), served by the BEAM            |
| `/usr/share/grappa/grappa.env.example` | env template                                               |
| `/usr/share/grappa/gen-secrets.sh`     | openssl secret generator                                   |
| `/usr/lib/systemd/system/grappa.service` | systemd vendor unit                                      |
| `/etc/grappa/grappa.env`               | secrets + `PHX_HOST` (created on first install, `0640`)     |
| `/var/lib/grappa/`                     | state: `grappa.db`, `uploads/` (owned by `grappa`)         |

The `grappa` system user (nologin, home `/var/lib/grappa`) is created by
the package.

### The terminal client

`shottino` (`frontends/shottino`, C + ncurses) has **its own package**,
built from `nfpm-shottino.yaml` (GH #1447).

It used to ship only inside the bouncer package, and the reason written
here was that splitting it "would add a second thing to maintain and buy
nothing: it is a client for the server you just installed." **That premise
was wrong, and the host it is wrong about is the ordinary one:** a machine
that wants to *talk to* a grappa somewhere else is not the machine running
it. Today that user has to take a self-contained ERTS and a built SPA —
37.0 MB of `.deb` at v1.2.0, essentially none of which the client uses —
and `postinstall.sh` enables a systemd unit they never asked for. The
client is one C binary against ncursesw and OpenSSL. A second yaml is a
smaller price than that.

The standalone package is deliberately thin: **one file**, no maintainer
scripts, no system user, no unit, and none of the bouncer's ERTS-side
dependencies. It carries the WIDE `libncursesw6` (NOT the `libncurses6`
ERTS wants — Debian ships them separately; Fedora folds both SONAMEs into
`ncurses-libs`), OpenSSL, and `ca-certificates`, because the client calls
`SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths()` and verifies with `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.

It keeps **its own version line** — `frontends/shottino/version.h`, read by
`version.sh shottino` — rather than the grappa tag. Two artifacts, two
cadences: `shottino --version` and the package version agree, which they
could not if the package were stamped with a bouncer release number.

Its metadata takes `/usr/bin/shottino` over from the bouncer with
`Replaces:` / `Breaks: grappa (<< 1.3.0)` (nfpm maps `replaces` to RPM's
`Obsoletes`). That boundary is historical — the first release that stops
shipping the file — so it is written as a constant and must not become
`${GRAPPA_VERSION}`: at 1.4.0 that would assert grappa 1.3.0 shipped a file
it did not. `deb.breaks` is also absent from nfpm's env-expansion list, so
an interpolation there reaches the control file verbatim.

**Where the split stands.** The bouncer package **still ships the client**;
dropping it from `nfpm.yaml` and from the AUR `PKGBUILD` is the next step.
Until then both packages own `/usr/bin/shottino` and cannot be
co-installed, so the standalone one is **built and proven on every
packaging job but not published**: it is written to `dist-shottino/`, and
the release workflow's upload steps are path-scoped globs (`path:
dist/*.deb`), so nothing outside `dist/` reaches the release. That
directory split is the only gate — `release_assets.sh found` matches by
name at ANY depth, so a file that reaches the artifact bundle WILL be
attached — and it is pinned by `test/infra/packaging_shottino_pkg_test.bats`.

Every package builds the client from source so it links the build host's
ncurses/openssl, the same constraint that governs the ERTS payload.
`SKIP_SHOTTINO=1` opts both the build and the client package out; without
that opt-out a failed client build FAILS the package build, because a
package that silently ships without a binary it advertises is worse than
one that refuses to build.

The build **prints the binary's size** (`==> shottino binary: N bytes`)
instead of recording it here. This paragraph carried "one ~180 KB binary"
for a long time with nothing behind it; a number in prose goes stale in
silence, while one in the build log is always that build's, on that host.

`build.sh` snapshots and restores `config.mk` around `./configure`:
that file is tracked, and leaving it modified makes the tree dirty, which
`Grappa.Version` reads as unreleased (`-<shortsha>` instead of the bare
tag) and would fail the release workflow's version proof.

## Building the `.deb`

The build needs Elixir 1.19 / OTP 28 **on glibc** (not the alpine dev
image — musl ERTS will not run on a Debian/Ubuntu target) plus `bun`.

### Locally, in an isolated container

Runs in a throwaway container with its own `_build`, so it never touches
the dev compose stack's shared `_build`:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src elixir:1.19-otp-28 bash -c '
  apt-get update -q && apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends curl unzip &&
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash && export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" &&
  infra/packaging/build.sh'
```

The `.deb` lands in `./dist/`.

### In CI (R3)

The tag-driven release workflow
([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml))
runs `build.sh` on a `setup-beam` runner (Elixir 1.19 / OTP 28) with `bun`
installed, **installs** the built `.deb` (so postinstall's openssl secrets +
packaged migrate run for real), asserts the migration count and that the
artifact reports the bare `X.Y.Z`, then uploads `dist/*.deb` to the GitHub
Release. `build.sh` downloads a pinned nfpm if it is not on PATH.

## Building the `.rpm`

Same substrate, same `build.sh` — set `GRAPPA_PKG_FORMAT=rpm`. The ONLY
hard constraint is the **payload**, not the packager: the release bundles
its own ERTS + the crypto/exqlite NIFs, all linked against the *build
host's* glibc/libssl. A Debian-built payload is a valid `.deb` and an
`.rpm` that installs cleanly and then dies at boot on Fedora. So the
`.rpm` **must** be built inside a Fedora userland with Fedora's own
Elixir/OTP:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src fedora:43 bash -c '
  dnf install -y --setopt=install_weak_deps=False \
    elixir erlang git gcc make pkgconf-pkg-config ncurses-devel \
    openssl-devel tar gzip unzip findutils sqlite openssl util-linux &&
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash && export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" &&
  GRAPPA_PKG_FORMAT=rpm infra/packaging/build.sh'
```

The `.rpm` lands in `./dist/`.

- **Fedora's own toolchain, never setup-beam.** `erlang` is Fedora's
  full-OTP metapackage. Like Arch (#527), Fedora splits OTP into per-app
  subpackages, and `mix release` needs the whole transitive app tree
  (`public_key`/`ssl`/`inets`/`runtime_tools`) at build time — so pull the
  meta, don't rely on `elixir`'s dep chain and don't enumerate subpackages
  (that list drifts as deps add OTP apps).
- **Per-format deps live in `nfpm.yaml` under `overrides.{deb,rpm}`** —
  one config, no duplicate file. The RPM names are the Fedora/RHEL twins of
  the Debian SONAME deps (`openssl-libs`, `ncurses-libs` — one package for
  both the narrow + wide ncurses, unlike Debian's split —, `libstdc++`,
  `libgcc`, `ca-certificates`, `shadow-utils`).
- **The maintainer scripts handle both arg conventions.** dpkg passes a
  string `$1` (`configure`/`remove`/`purge`); rpm passes a number
  (`1`/`2` install/upgrade, `0` uninstall). `scripts/*.sh` branch on both,
  so `%post`/`%preun`/`%postun` actually run on rpm (a deb-only
  `case $1 in configure)` would silently no-op → a package that installs
  and does nothing).
- **Fedora-family only.** A Fedora-built ERTS is NOT automatically valid
  on RHEL/Rocky/Alma (older glibc). The CI `rpm` job pins the *oldest
  still-supported* Fedora carrying Elixir 1.19 (glibc is
  backward-compatible, so the oldest floor = widest validity), and
  RHEL-family is explicitly out of scope. Widening that is a future matrix
  entry (a manylinux-style oldest-glibc build), not a one-line bump.

In CI the tag-driven release workflow's `rpm` job does exactly the above
in a pinned `fedora:43` container, `dnf install`s the built `.rpm` (so
`%post`'s openssl secrets + packaged migrate run for real), asserts the
migration count + the bare `X.Y.Z` + that shottino links Fedora's libs,
then uploads `dist/*.rpm` to the Release.

## Installing

```sh
sudo apt install ./grappa_<version>_<arch>.deb
sudoedit /etc/grappa/grappa.env          # set PHX_HOST=your.host
sudo systemctl start grappa
curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/healthz
```

`postinstall` creates the state dirs, copies the env template, generates
the secrets (openssl), runs migrations, seeds the built-in theme gallery
(#1167 — the palettes ship compiled into the release, but the gallery
reads the DB, so the package has to unpack them itself), and **enables
but does not start**
the service (it cannot start until you set a real `PHX_HOST`).

## First user

```sh
sudo grappa create-user you --admin
# password for you: (typed, not echoed)
```

No running node needed — this is the first-run door, so it opens the
database itself (#1158). `--admin` grants the operator bit in the same
command; without a password flag the password is read from the terminal,
so it stays out of shell history and out of the process table.

Give that account a network the same way:

```sh
sudo grappa add-network you azzurra \
  --server irc.azzurra.chat:6697 --nick you --auth sasl --autojoin '#grappa'
sudo grappa remove-network you azzurra   # the undo
```

An account alone cannot connect: a network needs at least one enabled
server, which is why `add-network` creates the network and the server
when they do not exist yet, and refuses rather than write access that
would fail at spawn time.

## Managing

```sh
sudo grappa migrate        # apply pending migrations (no mix needed)
sudo grappa seed-themes    # (re)materialise the built-in theme gallery
sudo grappa gen-secrets    # (re)generate missing secrets in the env file
sudo grappa version        # release version
sudo grappa remote         # IEx into the running node
sudo systemctl status grappa
journalctl -u grappa -f
```

Rotate a secret: reset it to `REPLACE_ME` in `/etc/grappa/grappa.env`,
run `sudo grappa gen-secrets`, then `sudo systemctl restart grappa`. Back
up `GRAPPA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` separately — it encrypts stored IRC
credentials at rest; losing it makes them unrecoverable.

## Secrets model

A packaged host has no mix, so `gen-secrets.sh` generates everything with
**openssl only**, matching the mix generators' shapes byte-for-byte:

| Var                     | How                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE`       | `openssl rand -base64 48`                                      |
| `SECRET_SIGNING_SALT`   | `openssl rand -base64 32`                                      |
| `RELEASE_COOKIE`        | `openssl rand -hex 32`                                         |
| `GRAPPA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `openssl rand -base64 32` (≡ `Base.encode64(rand_bytes(32))`)  |
| `VAPID_*`               | `openssl ecparam prime256v1` → base64url(65-byte point / 32-byte scalar) |

This keeps first-boot secret generation **off** the release `eval` path.

## Caveat — the migrate/eval proof

`grappa migrate` reaches `Ecto.Migrator` via
`bin/grappa eval 'Grappa.Release.migrate()'` — the same migrator the
FreeBSD/Docker deploys call. On the FreeBSD jail this works; but
`infra/linux/install.sh` documents that on a **native-Linux, asdf-built**
ERTS the release `eval`/`remote`/`rpc` boot variant crashes at kernel
start (a `persistent_term`/`code_server` badarg — even `eval '1 + 1'`),
and sidesteps it with `mix ecto.migrate`. A packaged host has no mix, so
`grappa migrate` **must** work through `eval` on the **packaged** ERTS.

Since #1158 the account verbs (`create-user`, `add-network`,
`remove-network`) ride the same `eval`, so they inherit this caveat
whole: they are the FIRST thing a fresh install runs, and on a substrate
where `eval` is broken they fail the same way `migrate` does, for the
same reason.

⚠️ **The same badarg has a second, unrelated cause — check this one first
(#1267).** ERTS dies at kernel start with the *identical*
`persistent_term`/`code_server` trace when the working directory it is
launched from lacks the **search (`x`) bit for the effective user**. Measured:
cwd `0700` dies, `0711` and `0555` boot; it reproduces on bare
`erl -boot .../start_clean` with no grappa module loaded, and it has nothing to
do with how the ERTS was built. Debian 13 ships `HOME_MODE 0700` and `/root` is
`0700`, so it fires from the operator's own login directory. `grappa-wrapper.sh`
`cd /`s before exec'ing the release since #1267; on an older package the
operator workaround is `cd /` before any `grappa` subcommand. Do not read a
`code_server` badarg as the asdf caveat below until the cwd has been ruled out.

R1's job is to prove exactly that on a package built by `build.sh`
(bundled ERTS, not asdf): install the `.deb` in a clean container, run
`sudo grappa migrate` against a fresh DB, confirm the service boots and
`/healthz` is green. If `eval` proves broken on the packaged ERTS too, the
fallback is a boot-time migrate flag — a separate design, **not** silently
bolted on here.

## Tracked follow-ups (status per item)

- **`.rpm`** — **shipped (#438)**, see **Building the `.rpm`** above. nfpm
  renders it from the same config; the bundled ERTS is glibc/libssl-specific,
  so it is built inside a Fedora container with Fedora's own Elixir/OTP.
  Fedora-family only (a Fedora ERTS is not a valid RHEL/Rocky/Alma payload).
- **Arch `PKGBUILD` + AUR recipe** — **shipped (R2)**, see
  [`aur/`](aur/README.md). A source package (`makepkg` builds on the target),
  which reuses this substrate's FHS paths + maintainer logic and sidesteps
  the cross-distro ERTS problem the binary `.rpm`/`.deb` face (build-host
  glibc/libssl) by compiling on the target.
- **Tag-driven release CI** (R3) — **shipped**
  ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml)):
  builds + proves + uploads per tag; regenerates the AUR recipe
  (`updpkgsums` + `makepkg --printsrcinfo`) and runs the full `makepkg` →
  `pacman -U` on a real x86_64 Arch runner. Publishing (AUR push) stays a
  human decision.
- **`grappa create-user`** subcommand — see First user.
- **`priv/static` single-tarball** — declined for packaging: the
  `CIC_DIST_ROOT`-relocatable model (Part 1) ships the dist as a separate
  payload, which is exactly what packaging needs.
