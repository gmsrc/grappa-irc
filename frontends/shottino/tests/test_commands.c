/* test_commands — the command lists have to agree with the dispatcher.
 *
 * A slash command lives in three places in shottino.c: the dispatcher in
 * handle_input() that does the work, the `commands[]` table that makes it
 * tab-complete, and the show_command_help() chain that answers
 * `/help <verb>`. Nothing links them, so they drift — and they had: of the
 * 79 working verbs, 36 did not tab-complete and 32 had no help topic.
 *
 * Both gaps are invisible in use, and both read as "this command does not
 * exist" rather than as a bug in the client: Tab on a missing entry does
 * nothing, and /help on a missing topic says so in as many words. Neither
 * shows up as a warning or a crash, so this suite is the only thing that
 * notices.
 *
 * It asserts by SCANNING shottino.c for the dispatcher's own string
 * literals rather than by keeping a fourth list — a fourth list would be
 * one more thing to forget. The scan is deliberately dumb: it looks for the
 * exact shapes the dispatcher uses (`strcmp(line, "/verb"`,
 * `strncmp(line, "/verb "` and `verb_args(line, "/verb"`), so a NEW dispatch
 * shape reads as zero verbs and the floor assertion fails loudly instead of
 * passing vacuously.
