/* test.h — the smallest thing that can hold shottino honest.
 *
 * Shottino shipped without any test target. The wire-narrowing and
 * formatting code being added for cicchetto parity is pure (bytes in,
 * typed values out) and is exactly the kind of code that rots silently in
 * C, so it gets tests. No framework dependency: a header of macros, one
 * `main` per suite, non-zero exit on failure.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   TEST(name) { ... CHECK(cond); CHECK_STR(a, b); }
 *   int main(void) { RUN(name); return test_report(); }
 *
 * A suite that #includes ../shottino.c calls test_use_temp_home() as the
 * first statement of main — see below, and `make check-home-guard`.
