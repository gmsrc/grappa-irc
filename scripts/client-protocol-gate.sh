# scripts/client-protocol-gate.sh — every client event kind has a doc entry (issue 2260).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/client-protocol-gate.sh              # check docs/CLIENT_PROTOCOL.md
#   scripts/client-protocol-gate.sh <doc-path>   # check another copy of it
#
# The optional path is what lets `test/scripts/client_protocol_gate_test.bats`
# judge the gate against a MUTATED copy without writing to the tree — the same
# affordance `scripts/design-notes-gate.sh <base-ref>` carries. The derivation
# side is never parameterised: there is one generated artefact and pointing the
# gate at a fake one would prove nothing about this repo.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS
#
# `docs/CLIENT_PROTOCOL.md` is the contract a third-party client author reads.
# The server pushes typed `"event"` frames whose `kind` discriminates the
# payload, and nothing tied the set of kinds it EMITS to the set the document
# ANNOUNCES. The author of Sythos met `topic_changed` and
# `channel_modes_changed` on the wire with no document naming either. The
# wire is additive-only, so a client must tolerate an unknown `kind` — but
# "tolerate" is not "discover", and an undocumented kind is a feature no
# second client can implement.
#
# WHY THE SOURCE IS THE GENERATED ARTEFACT
#
# `cicchetto/src/lib/wireTypes.ts` is emitted by `mix grappa.gen_wire_types`
# from `lib/grappa/**/*wire.ex` plus the task's `@extra_modules`, and held by
# `mix grappa.gen_wire_types --check` in `scripts/check.sh` and CI. So it
# cannot drift from the typespecs behind the server's back, and reading it
# here reuses that guarantee instead of re-implementing a typespec walk.
#
# It also carries the one fact a grep over `lib/` cannot recover: the emitting
# MODULE, as a `// === Grappa.Foo.Wire ===` section marker. That is what makes
# the client/admin split derivable rather than a hand-kept list of names — see
# `web_session_severed` below.
#
# 🔴 A GREP OVER `lib/` IS THE WRONG SOURCE, MEASURED (issue 2260)
#
# The issue's own table was built with a regex over `"kind" => "…"` /
# `kind: "…"` in `lib/`, and it is wrong in both directions: it missed 22 of
# the 29 undocumented kinds, and it listed one — `parted` — that the server
# DELIBERATELY DOES NOT EMIT. `git grep -cE 'kind: :parted' -- lib` is 0; what
# the regex actually matched is prose inside comments that say the opposite
# ("there is intentionally NO `kind: "parted"` broadcast — absence is the
# signal", `session/server.ex` and `session/window_state.ex`). Documenting
# `parted` would put a lie in the protocol, against an absence the code
# declares to BE the signal. Hence: typespecs, never a text scan of sources.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A CLIENT KIND
#
# `lib/grappa_web/channels/user_socket.ex` routes exactly two topics:
# `grappa:user:*` to `GrappaWeb.GrappaChannel` and `grappa:admin:events` to
# `GrappaWeb.AdminChannel`. So a kind is client-facing iff its carrier can
# reach the first. `Topic.session_log/0` and `Topic.server_settings/0` are
# routed to NO channel; they are internal.
#
# The exclusions below are therefore by emitting MODULE wherever the carrier
# decides it, and by NAME only for the three `kind:` fields that are not event
# discriminators at all. Both lists FAIL CLOSED: a new `*.Wire` module is in
# scope by default and must be documented. Excluding one is a deliberate edit.
#
# WHY NOT AN ExUnit TEST
#
# `docs/` is NOT in the worktree bind-mount list (`scripts/_lib.sh`) — only
# `lib`, `test`, `config`, `cicchetto/src`, `priv/wire`, `infra`, `bin` and a
# handful of root files are. A test reading `docs/CLIENT_PROTOCOL.md` from
# inside the container would read the IMAGE's copy, i.e. MAIN's, and report a
# confident verdict about a file that is not the one under change. Verified:
# `SRC_ROOT/docs` appears 0 times in that mount array while `SRC_ROOT/CLAUDE.md`
# appears once. This gate runs on the HOST, against the worktree, like
# `scripts/design-notes-gate.sh`.

# NOTE `web_session_severed` exists TWICE under two different modules:

# a kind clients really do receive — which is exactly why this list is by
# module.
#
# Matched against the module name ALONE, as an awk field — not against the
# `module<TAB>kind` line. An earlier cut of this gate anchored the alternatives
# with `^`/`$` inside a line-oriented regex, where `$` can never match after
# the module because the tab and the kind follow it; the filter silently
# excluded nothing and the gate demanded doc rows for all 29 admin kinds.
