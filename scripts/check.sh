# Run the full CI gate locally inside the container.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check.sh
#
# Same gates as the `ci` GitHub workflow, in two stages:
#
#   stage 1: the `mix ci.check` alias in mix.exs (the gate list lives there).
#   stage 2 (this script): the cic↔server wire-shape drift gate, the #1393d
#            wire-shape pin, then the host-side bats suite.
#
# Pins MIX_ENV=dev via scripts/mix.sh (credo / sobelow / ex_doc are dev-only
# deps). Two sub-steps inside the alias shell out with `cmd env MIX_ENV=test`:
# the test run (so Repo gets the Sandbox pool) and, since #621, doctor.
# Why: docs/OPERATIONS.md § "Developer and deploy scripts (scripts/*.sh)".
#
# Canonical "which test runner do I use?" docs: docs/TESTING.md.

# #1393d — the wire-shape pin: fails when the generated shape moved and
# `Grappa.Protocol.version/0` did not. A SEPARATE gate from the line above
# because that one has no BEFORE — it diffs the artefact against its own
# source, so a regenerated additive field reads `in sync.`, which is the
# case this rule exists for. The BEFORE is priv/wire/shape.pin; no network.
