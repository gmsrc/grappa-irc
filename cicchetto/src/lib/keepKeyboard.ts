// UX-3 preserve-keyboard global — keep the iOS on-screen keyboard up
// across taps on anything that isn't a different input.
//
// Per-button `onPointerDown` wiring is fragile: every new tappable
// surface (BottomBar tab, scroll-to-bottom arrow, archive row,
// future buttons) has to remember to call the preserve helper. One
// missed wiring re-introduces the bug.
//
// Instead, install ONE document-level capture listener at boot. When
// the compose `<input>` (or any input/textarea) currently has focus
// and a `mousedown` lands on an element that is NOT a different
// input/textarea, preventDefault on the mousedown cancels the
// implicit focus shift. The click still fires (different event), the
// tapped element's onClick still runs, but iOS doesn't dismiss the
// keyboard because focus never moved.
//
// CRITICAL: this hooks `mousedown`, NOT `pointerdown`. iOS Safari
// dispatches BOTH events; `pointerdown` is also the gesture-start
// signal for scroll/pan, so `preventDefault` on `pointerdown` blocks
// scroll inside touched scroll containers (vjt 2026-05-18: archive
// modal list couldn't be scrolled after TER-DEC pointerdown variant
// shipped). `mousedown` is the legacy focus-shift carrier and does
// NOT participate in iOS's scroll-gesture dispatch — preventing it
// suppresses focus only, leaving scroll/pan untouched.
//
// Capture phase so we run BEFORE any element's own mousedown handler
// (relevant if a handler stops propagation).
//
// Target-guard: only fires when target is NOT itself an input/textarea
// (a tap on a different text field MUST allow the focus transfer so
// the user can actually type in the new field).
//
// iOS-only, gated in the handler via isIos(). mousedown's default
// action is not just the focus shift — it is ALSO the start of a
// text-selection drag, so preventDefault kills text selection wherever
// it fires. With the compose box autofocused (the normal cic state)
// that made scrollback text unselectable on desktop. Full arc +
// known limitations (iPad-with-trackpad, Android unvalidated):
// docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md 2026-06-11.
//
// The gate sits in the handler, not at install time, for test
// isolation: the document-level capture listener has no uninstall
// path, so an install-time gate would leak an ungated listener from
// an iOS-UA test into every later desktop-UA test. Per-event cost is
// one regex on a ~Hz event — immaterial.
//
// SCOPE, since #1067: this module owns the KEYBOARD only. #366 had also hung a
// touchend-driven "select the whole message row" affordance off the same
// long-press; that is gone — a long-press on a message row now opens the
// message menu (Copy / Reply / Select…), and the swipe-to-reply lives beside
// it, both in `lib/messageGestures` bound at element level on the scrollback.
// Two owners for one gesture stream is how #366's select-all ended up fighting
// the affordance that replaced it.

// long-press (keep the keyboard so the selection survives) and skip it
// for a tap (let the keyboard dismiss). This list MUST stay in sync with
// default.css's `.scrollback, .topic-modal-text` `user-select: text`
// re-enable, which #1869 moved from `html.is-ios` into
// `@media (pointer: coarse)` — a new copyable surface must be added to
// BOTH sites or the two policies drift (same shape as the nick-fold
// SQL/fragment invariant). See docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md 2026-06-11

// they fall through to the always-fire preventDefault path (keyboard kept
// on tap AND long-press, never a tap-to-close).
//
// This is the KEYBOARD/focus policy, which is INDEPENDENT of the CSS
// text-selection policy (default.css's `@media (pointer: coarse)`
// `user-select` re-exclude) — do NOT assume this list mirrors the CSS one:
//   * `.scrollback-invite-join` (the [Join] CTA) is a non-copyable
//     control, so it is in BOTH: keyboard-preserve here AND
//     `user-select: none` in CSS.
//   * `.scrollback-link` (a linkified URL, #350) is a COPYABLE control —
//     tap should keep the keyboard (it's a tap-to-navigate control, the
//     mousedown preventDefault leaves the click's `target=_blank`
//     navigation untouched), but its URL text must stay copyable, so it
//     is deliberately NOT in the CSS re-exclude. Forcing `user-select:
//     none` on an inline link would drop its URL from a drag-selection
//     that SPANS it (a spanning selection starts on adjacent text, so the
//     link's own mousedown preventDefault never sees it) — exactly the
//     regression `.nick-clickable` fixed in #250 by keeping a
//     clickable-but-copyable inline element `user-select: text`. Keyboard
//     policy ≠ selection policy for content that is also a control.
// `.scrollback-link` also covers media links (`.scrollback-media-link` is
// applied alongside it, MircText.tsx). See DESIGN_NOTES 2026-07-20 (#350).
//   * `.nick-clickable` (the sender nick rendered inline as an open-query
//     control, #354) is the SAME class as `.scrollback-link`: a COPYABLE
//     inline control. A tap should keep the keyboard (it opens a query; the
//     mousedown preventDefault leaves the click's open-query onClick
//     untouched), but its nick text must stay copyable, so — like the link —
//     it is deliberately NOT in the CSS `user-select` re-exclude (forcing
//     `user-select: none` is the exact `.nick-clickable` regression #250
//     fixed). Before #354 it fell onto the duration-gated selectable path
//     (inside `.scrollback`, not excluded), so a TAP dropped the keyboard and
//     a LONG-PRESS select-all'd the row — both wrong for a control. Same
//     class of bug as #350. See DESIGN_NOTES 2026-07-26 (#354).
//   * `.channel-clickable` (#648 — a `#channel` in scrollback rendered inline
//     as a click-to-join control, MircText.renderChannel) is the SAME class of
//     inline control as `.nick-clickable`: a tap opens the join-confirm (keep
//     the keyboard), its text stays copyable (NOT in the CSS `user-select`
//     re-exclude, so a spanning drag-selection still grabs it), and a
//     long-press must not select-all the row.
// Exported since #1067: `lib/messageGestures` arms the swipe-to-reply and the
// long-press menu on the SAME rows, and must skip the SAME controls — sharing
// the constant is what keeps the two policies from drifting apart.
