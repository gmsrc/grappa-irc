// issue 2160 — iPadOS paints its multitasking control (the three-dot pill) over
// the top-LEADING corner of every windowed app, and in a narrow Split View pane
// that corner is cicchetto's own pane chrome: the channel name on a channel
// window, and — when the mobile window bar is off (#1766) — the window-list ☰,
// which is a CONTROL and not just text (iOS swallows touches under its own
// chrome, so an occluded button is a dead button).
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A SAFE-AREA FIX. Measured on the reporter's device (iPad Pro
// 11, iPadOS 26.7, narrow multitasking pane), TWICE — once in Safari and once in
// the INSTALLED PWA (`standalone: true`), which is the configuration the symptom
// was reported from:
//
//   safe-area top/right/bottom/left : 0px / 0px / 0px / 0px   (both samples)
//   visualViewport / window.inner   : 417 x 676   (PWA)   380 x 650  (Safari)
//   screen w x h                    : 834 x 1194  (both samples)
//
// WebKit does not declare the pill through `env(safe-area-inset-*)` in windowed
// mode, in either host. There is no platform signal to react to: the Window
// Controls Overlay API (`titlebar-area-*`) is the web's answer for this shape
// and WebKit does not implement it. So the clearance has to be taken by LAYOUT,
// and `src/__tests__/safeAreaInsetToken.test.ts` stays the authority on `env()`
// — nothing here writes one.
//
// THE CONDITION IS GEOMETRY, AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE POINT. A pill-sized gap
// hard-coded on every narrow viewport is paid by every phone, which has no pill
// — the trap #985 spent a band escaping. The discriminator is that the viewport
// is narrower than the DISPLAY it sits on, i.e. the app does not own the whole
// screen: measured above as 417 wide against a 834-wide screen. A full-screen
// app cannot satisfy that by construction — its viewport width IS one of the
// screen's two edges, so it is never below the shorter one. The CSS twin of
// `screen.width` is the `device-width` media feature (CSS MQ4 keeps the
// deprecated device-* features REQUIRED for compat), so the gate needs no
// runtime writer and no UA sniff.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS DO NOT CLAIM. The pill's own box was never measured — no
// probe reported it and Playwright/webkit does not reproduce iPadOS window
// chrome. The clearance is DERIVED from the symptom (see the value test below)
// and is an estimate; it lives in one token so a device measurement retunes it
// in one edit.
