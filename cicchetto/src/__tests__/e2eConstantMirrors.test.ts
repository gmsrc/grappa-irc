// #1646 — the e2e tree hand-copies production constants, and until this file
// nothing compared a copy with its original.
//
// The copies are deliberate: `e2e/` is its own package (`e2e/package.json`,
// playwright-only) and `fixtures/grappaApi.ts` spells out why the ONE import it
// allows itself is type-only — a value import would reach the solid-js
// dependency graph that keeps the runner image a pure REST/IRC client. The
// mirroring is not the defect. The defect is that "kept in lockstep by hand"
// had no witness: every one of the declarations below could be edited, or its
// original could move, and every gate in the repo stayed green.
//
// So the pin reads the e2e declaration as TEXT and compares it with the
// production constant IMPORTED here. The two sides come from genuinely
// different places — a module import and a file the test never imports — which
// is what makes the comparison able to fail. It fails in both directions:
// change production and the import moves while the text does not; change the
// copy and the text moves while the import does not.
//
// This lives in `src/__tests__/` rather than in `e2e/fixtures/` (which the
// vitest lane also collects) precisely BECAUSE of the rule it is guarding: a
// pin in `e2e/` would have to import src values, which is the edge the e2e
// package refuses. Reading the spec files as text creates no import edge at
// all. Sibling of `biomePin.test.ts` / `moduleRootGuard.test.ts` /
// `versionSource.test.ts` — vitest runs from the cicchetto dir, so both `src`
// and `e2e` are at cwd.
//
// ⚠️ SCOPE. #1646 measured 13 production constants copied into 53 e2e
// declarations. Slice 1 pinned the 6 whose production side was TypeScript and
// ALREADY exported — 11 declarations — and left the other 7 to a product call.
// Slice 2 took that call (vjt, 2026-08-21) and closed all of them:
//   - `SCROLL_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD_PX` + `LOAD_MORE_THRESHOLD_PX` (22 declarations)
//     MOVED out of `ScrollbackPane.tsx` into `src/lib/scrollThresholds.ts`,
//     which argues its own case. They are `MIRRORS` rows like any other now.
//   - `PUSH_OPTIN_DECLINED_KEY` + `SHORT_HASH_LEN` (1 each) were already under
//     `lib/` and only lacked `export`; each declaration says why exporting it
//     gives away nothing it had.
//   - `AWAY_SET_NOTICE` (1) stays private, and is pinned by `TEXT_MIRRORS` —
//     the weaker text-vs-text oracle. See that table for the refusal.
//   - the 2 Elixir module attributes (17 declarations) are pinned SERVER-SIDE,
//     in `test/grappa_web/controllers/messages_limit_mirror_test.exs`. They
//     cannot be pinned from here: `scripts/bun.sh` bind-mounts ONLY
//     `cicchetto/` at `/app`, so no path from this file reaches `lib/*.ex`.
//     Do not try — `../lib` RESOLVES inside that container, to the Debian
//     image's own `/lib`, and only the read fails.
// `mix grappa.gen_wire_types` was considered for the Elixir pair and declined:
// it ships wire TYPES, and teaching it to carry arbitrary constants inflates it
// for two numbers a text read already covers.
//
// ⚠️ What this CANNOT do: it cannot find a mirror that has ALREADY drifted.
// Every declaration below was found because the two sides carry the same
// literal today. A copy that already disagrees with production is invisible to
// the census that produced this table, and adding it here is the only way it
// enters. `KNOWN_UNPINNED` names the one set where that question is open.
