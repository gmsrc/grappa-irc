  // resource selection algorithm — but only when `networkState` is
  // NETWORK_EMPTY, and an Icecast connection that drops mid-stream does not
  // land there. `load()` runs that algorithm unconditionally, and the only
  // `load()` in this component was on the CLOSE path, where it DETACHES a
  // source. Nothing on the resume path re-fetched. (Read off the HTML media
  // element spec, not measured in a browser — see the test-level notes below
  // for what these assertions do and do not establish.)
  //
  // TWO SOURCES OF TRUTH FOR ONE CONTROL, which is the deeper half. The
  // button's LABEL came from the `playing()` signal (driven by events) and its
  // ACTION came from `audioEl.paused` (the element's own property). Those agree
  // until something goes wrong and then they do not, and a control whose action
  // disagrees with its label does the opposite of what the operator read. The
  // fix is not a third state: it is deriving both from `playing()`.
  //
  // WE DO NOT DISTINGUISH "paused" FROM "interrupted", and that is deliberate
  // rather than a gap we could not close. There is no reliable signal for it —
  // but more to the point, the question does not need answering. The axis that
  // matters is "is there a POSITION worth resuming to", and for a live source
  // there is none: `currentTime` is elapsed-since-tune-in, not a place in a
  // work. Resuming a live stream in place is not a feature being sacrificed, it
  // is a defect of its own — you come back to buffered audio and stay exactly

  // #1734 — LEAVING A WINDOW AND COMING BACK.
  //
  // The source is MODULE state and outlives this component, but the ELEMENT
  // does not: navigating a scrollback window → home / list / mentions / admin
  // unmounts the player. Coming back re-mounts it, the `on(activeAudio, …)`
  // effect runs its FIRST execution, and a re-mount is indistinguishable from
  // a new source at that point — so a file used to restart from zero, unasked.
  //
  // MEASURED before the fix, and the second line is why the shape below is
  // what it is:
  //
  //   [FILE]   before: play=1 currentTime=42 duration=180 seek-max=180
  //            after:  play=2 currentTime=0                seek-max=0
  //   [STREAM] before: live-badge=true
  //            after:  live-badge=FALSE  seek-present=TRUE
  //
  // A re-mounted STREAM came back dressed as a file. `live()` reads `duration`,
  // a signal of THIS component, and a re-mount recreates it at 0 — a finite
  // number. So #1700's `mustRefetch` (`el.error !== null || live()`) answers
  // "no re-fetch needed" for a stream too, and cannot tell the two apart at the
  // one moment that matters. Restoring the remembered `duration` BEFORE
  // consulting it is what puts the predicate back in a position to answer, and
  // is why there is no second predicate here.
  //
  // WHY RESUME AND NOT SIT STILL. Sitting still needs the same remembered
  // `duration` (a stream must still re-tune — #1700's rule), and it needs the
  // position too or the transport reads 0:00 on a file that is at 0:42. Once
  // both are restored the only thing left to decide is whether to call
  // `play()`, and the operator never asked for a stop: they changed window. So
  // the transport is preserved rather than chosen — playing resumes, paused
  // stays paused. Anything else is cic originating state.

  //   download link                    present
  //
  // NOT MERELY MUTE — LYING, and the second half is why this is more than one
  // span. `loadedmetadata` never arrives, so `duration` stays at 0, which is a
  // FINITE number, so `live()` answers false and the bar dresses a dead endless
  // stream as a FILE: a scrubber over nothing and a `0:00 / 0:00` readout. The
  // failure therefore REPLACES the readout rather than joining it.
  //
  // THE DOWNLOAD ANCHOR IS THE EXCEPTION, and finding it is what split that
  // <Show> in two. It sat inside the file readout because the two share a
  // predicate, not because they answer the same question — and an upload the
  // browser cannot DECODE is exactly the upload the operator wants to SAVE.
  // Taking it away would remove the remedy at the moment it is needed. So the
  // notice replaces the readout, and the anchor keeps #682's own `live()`
  // gate, unchanged.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS NOT A SECOND PREDICATE BESIDE `mustRefetch` (#1700's rule that
  // the predicate is one). Two independent reasons, and either is sufficient:
  //   * `mustRefetch` is `el.error !== null || live()`, so it is TRUE for every
  //     healthy live stream. A surface gated on it would show a failure on
  //     every station that works.
  //   * It is a question ASKED OF THE ELEMENT at the instant of a decision, and
  //     `el.error` is a plain property. Solid cannot subscribe to it, so no
  //     amount of asking re-renders anything. The signal below is the reactive
  //     record of the EVENT, which is a different object with a different job:
  //     `mustRefetch` decides whether to call `load()`, this decides what the
  //     operator is told. They can legitimately disagree — a retry clears the
  //     notice while `el.error` is still set until the new fetch lands.
