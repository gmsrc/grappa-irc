// #1698 — the docked bar's layout contract, read off the STYLESHEET.
//
// WHY A CSS-TEXT GUARD AND NOT A DOM ASSERTION. #1697's finding, one bar over:
// `.rail-radio-picker-close` wore a shared button class and then re-declared
// its own size 2rem below it, and the DOM assertion stayed GREEN — jsdom
// applies no stylesheet and computes no layout, so only a guard on the CSS text
// can see a cascade override at all. That is the mechanism here too, and the
// stake is the same one: this row is the WHOLE player on a phone, and a text
// span that can grow without bound pushes ✕ past the right edge, where it
// cannot be tapped.
//
// #1698 adds a SECOND growable text span to a row that had one. That is exactly
// the edit the rule below exists to survive, so it is pinned rather than
// assumed.
//
// And the budget it is spent against SHRANK while this was in flight: #1697
// landed a fourth fixed-width control (the hide chevron) into the same row, so
// the two spans now share what is left after 4 × 2.5rem rather than 3 × 2.5rem.
// Both slices are individually defensible and neither measured the sum — which
// is why the ⚠️ below is not boilerplate on this branch.
//
// ⚠️ What this does NOT establish, stated because a green here is easy to
// over-read: it says the declarations are present, not that the bar fits on any
// particular device. Real widths are device territory.
