// issue 2188 — the media viewer's size FLOOR, asserted at SOURCE level (the
// mediaViewerTouchAction/ipadSafeArea precedent): jsdom applies no stylesheet,
// so a getComputedStyle oracle here would read `min-height` back as empty
// whether or not the declaration exists, and would pass for the wrong reason.
//
// What is therefore NOT covered anywhere: the RENDERED layout. Nothing in this
// repo has ever observed the viewer's painted box — these assertions say the
// sheet declares the floor, not that a phone honours it.
//
// The bug the floor answers: every other size declaration in the chain is a
// CAP, so the modal was exactly as big as its content and a small image opened
// as a postage stamp. vjt, #grappa 2026-09-14 23:38 (height) and 23:39 (width).
