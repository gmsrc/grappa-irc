// #1697 — the DOCKED transport's chrome, from the CSS side.
//
// This file deliberately asserts NOTHING about the row's tap floor, and the
// omission is the point rather than an oversight.
//
// What was measured: `html { font-size: var(--font-size) }` with
// `--font-size: 14px`, so the row's `min-width/height: 2.5rem` resolves to
// 35px — under the 44px `--tap-min` floor. Same class as the rail picker's ✕
// at 2rem/28px; #115 sized these in rem and #306's absolute-px sweep never
// reached them.
//
// Why it is not fixed here: #1697 names the PICKER's ✕. Lifting this row grows
// the docked bar by ~9px, a visible change to a surface that was looked at and
// approved. That decision is not this issue's to take, so the finding was
// carved out and filed on its own.
//
// A test asserting `2.5rem` would be worse than no test — it would encode a
// known defect and stop anyone from finding it (CLAUDE.md: never assert buggy
// behavior). So what is pinned here is floor-NEUTRAL: that the control this
// issue adds is styled by the row's SHARED rule rather than by a bespoke copy
// beside it. When the carve-out lands, all four move together because they
// already share one rule.
//
// jsdom applies no stylesheet, so this reads the source. It proves what the
// cascade is asked to do, never what a device paints.
