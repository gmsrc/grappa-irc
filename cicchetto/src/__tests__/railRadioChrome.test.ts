// #1697 — the rail radio's chrome, from the CSS side.
//
// Two defects with ONE root: the picker carried a hand-rolled `--rail-radio-*`
// chrome layer instead of the band `PaneTopBar` already provides, and its
// buttons sized their tap target in `rem`.
//
// The rem part is arithmetic, not taste. `html { font-size: var(--font-size) }`
// and `--font-size: 14px`, so the `min-width/height: 2rem` these two buttons
// carried resolved to 28px — against `--tap-min: 44px` (Apple HIG) and
// `--chrome-tap-min: 48px`. That is the whole reason the ✕ "renders but does
// not land". The cure is not a bigger number: it is wearing
// `.shell-chrome-btn`, which already carries the floor for every other chrome
// button in the app.
//
// jsdom applies no stylesheet, so this reads the source. It proves what the
// cascade is asked to do, never what a device paints — the tap itself is
// e2e/dogfood territory.
