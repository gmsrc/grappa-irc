// #717 — the recoverability half, tested through the REAL resource cascade.
//
// An earlier version of this file built its own resource inside the component
// and mocked `lib/networks` away. It passed against an implementation that did
// NOT fix #717, because the three things it changed are exactly the three that
// break in production:
//
//   * `networks` is `createResource(user, …)` and `channelsBySlug` is
//     `createResource(networks, …)`, so Solid compiles a `createMemo(user)`
//     that reads the failing resource;
//   * that memo lives in the module-level `createRoot` opened by
//     `identityScopedStore`, OUTSIDE the render tree;
//   * a throw from there has no error context, so `runUpdates` discards the
//     queued render effects — including the boundary's — and the DOM keeps the
//     splash forever.
//
// ORDER IS THE WHOLE TEST. An earlier rewrite still passed against the broken
// implementation because it let `me()` reject during the `await import(...)`
// calls, BEFORE `render()`. A resource that is already `errored` at first paint
// throws synchronously inside the boundary — no update cycle, nothing to abort,
// and the bug is invisible. Production is the opposite: `main.tsx` imports
// statically and renders in the same turn, so the rejection ALWAYS lands after
// the first paint, in an update cycle a context-less module root can abort.
//
// So the `me` mock hands back a promise this file settles by hand, AFTER
// `render()` has run. Falsified: reverting `identityScopedStore` to a bare
// `createRoot` turns the first case below red.
//
// Mocks ONLY `lib/api` (the network edge) — real `lib/networks`, real
// `identityScopedStore`, real cascade. `vi.resetModules` per test because these
// stores are module singletons.

// Only the three network calls are stubbed; everything else in `lib/api` stays
// REAL. `ApiError` in particular must be the genuine class — the fallback
// narrows with `instanceof` to route typed errors through `friendlyApiError`,
// and a stubbed stand-in would make that branch untestable (and quietly dead).
