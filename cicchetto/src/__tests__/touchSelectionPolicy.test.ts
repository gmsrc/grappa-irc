// #1869 — the selection/callout policy is TOUCH behaviour, not iOS behaviour.
//
// It used to sit under `html.is-ios`, a class `lib/platform.ts` adds only when
// `isIos()`, so Android got NONE of it: nothing suppressed Chrome's own
// long-press callout, and one press on a message row opened TWO menus — the
// platform's selection toolbar over a native selection of the row, plus cic's
// message menu behind it. Device-verified on an Android 17 emulator, Chrome
// 151: `window.getSelection()` came back non-collapsed with the pressed word
// while cic's menu reported open in the same frame.
//
// WHY A SOURCE-LEVEL TEST TOO, next to the e2e ones. jsdom applies no
// stylesheet, so nothing here can read a computed value. What this file reads
// is the SHAPE of the sheet — which rules exist and where they are gated —
// which is what rots when someone adds a re-enable and forgets the gate.
//
// The COMPUTED side is covered in e2e and needs no `emulateMedia`: both
// `webkit-iphone-15` and `chromium-pixel-touch` report `pointer: coarse`
// natively, so `issue1869-android-longpress-selection.spec.ts` (Blink) and the
// `@webkit` twins in `text-selection-restored` / `issue250-android-nick-select`
// assert the real cascade on both engine families.
//
// What NO project can do is render a platform's native selection UI, so
// "does the toolbar actually appear?" stays a device question — the limit
// #1067 and #1857 declare, and #1869 verified by hand on Android.
//
// THE DRIFT THIS GUARDS. The kill and its re-enables are one atomic set: #79
// (scrollback + topic text), #1067 (the `is-selecting` callout latch), #508
// (<select> pickers), #589 (admin panes), plus the two re-excludes that carve
// out of them. Widening the kill while leaving a re-enable behind does not
// fail loudly — it silently makes that surface uncopyable on every touch
// device. So the assertion is a SET comparison, not a spot-check.

// Every selector the touch policy owns, with the declaration that proves it is
// the policy rule and not something else that happens to share the selector.
