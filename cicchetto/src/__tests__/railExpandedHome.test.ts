// #1040 — the CSS half of the expanded home rail. RailActions.test.tsx pins the
// component half (which kind expands, what stops being rendered, what refcount
// is not held); this pins the geometry, which is where the whole difference
// between "expanded column" and "overlay left open" actually lives.
//
// The base `.rail-actions-menu` is built for a popover floating over a nick
// list: `position: absolute`, `bottom: 100%` (it opens UPWARD), and a
// `max-height` derived from the JS-measured space above the launcher (#588 →
// #913). Every one of those exists because a menu opening upward over a list
// has only the space above it. Home has no list — `RailContext` renders nothing
// for the kind — so the constraint is gone and the column lays out in flow.
//
// Leaving any single one of these on would ship a subtly broken rail rather
// than a loud one: still absolute → the column overlays whatever the rail
// holds and the aside collapses to nothing; still `margin-top: auto` → the
// buttons hug the bottom edge instead of reading from the top; still capped by
// `--rail-menu-space-above` → the cap is measured only while the transient menu
// is open, so on home it falls back to the pre-measure viewport value and the
// rows can grow past the rail. Source-level guards, because jsdom resolves
// neither `calc()` nor a flex layout — the felt result is the e2e's job
// (issue1040-home-rail-expanded.spec.ts).
