// #1262 — channel status-prefix MODE rows (the churn) fold into the denoise
// filter; own-nick mode rows on `$server` do not, and since issue 2176 neither
// do the STRUCTURAL channel modes (last test in this file).
//
// `:mode` was carved OUT of the suppressed set by #458 on the rule "the broad
// presence/control kinds carry operator-relevant signal and MUST stay
// visible". vjt withdrew that rule on 2026-08-13, so `:mode` is now the fifth
// plain kind in `Grappa.Scrollback.Message.suppressed_presence_kinds/0` and in
// cic's `SUPPRESSED_PRESENCE_KINDS`.
//
// ## What this e2e owns vs what the unit tests own
//
// The SET membership is pinned in `test/grappa/scrollback/message_test.exs` and
// `src/__tests__/presenceFilter.test.ts`, and the two languages are held equal
// by the parser gate in `test/grappa/presence_filter_test.exs`. The `$server`
// resolve-to-SHOW rule is pinned in
// `test/grappa/presence_filter/resolver_test.exs`. None of those can see the
// VISIBLE outcome, which is what this spec owns:
//
//   1. a channel MODE row renders, then DISAPPEARS the moment the channel is
//      denoised (the cic render filter), and
//   2. it is still gone after a RELOAD — i.e. the SERVER omitted it from the
//      cold-load page, not merely cic hiding it. This is the half that would
//      regress if only one side of the mirror moved; and
//   3. the own-nick `$server` mode row SURVIVES the same reload, because
//      `$server` has no member count and resolves to SHOW.
//
// A content row rides along throughout as the load witness: it proves the
// page is populated, so "0 mode rows" means folded rather than "nothing
// loaded yet" (an empty pane would satisfy the mode assertion vacuously).
//
// ## 🔴 The churn exemplar MOVED from `+m` to `-o` (issue 2176)
//
// This spec used to set `/mode <chan> +m` as its specimen of "a channel MODE
// row". Issue 2176 reclassified `+m`: a mode that changes the CHANNEL (`+b`,
// `+k`, `+l`, `+m`, `+i`, `+t`, `+n`, `+s`) is STRUCTURAL and stays visible
// while denoised; only a member's status prefix (`+o`/`-o`, `+v`, and whatever
// else this network put in `PREFIX=`) is the churn this filter folds.
//
// So the CLAIM below is untouched and still gated — a channel MODE row that is
// churn folds, server-side too. What changed is the SPECIMEN, because the old
// one stopped being churn. This is deliberate, not an assert softened to turn a
// red green: `+m` now has its own test at the bottom of this file asserting the
// OPPOSITE outcome, and removing the structural/churn distinction kills that
// one. Read the two together.
//
// ## Why the spec creates its own channel
//
// `/join` on a fresh name makes the seeded user the channel creator, hence
// chanop — the same trick #240 uses for the mode modal. On a shared autojoin
// channel the user may not be op, and bahamut only echoes a MODE it actually
// applied, so a non-op attempt would hang to timeout rather than fail
// (feedback: the witness must be SERVED by the ircd).
//
// That precondition is also WHY the churn specimen is `-o` on our own nick
// rather than `+v`: being op is a fact this spec already establishes and
// depends on, so deopping ourselves is guaranteed to be applied and echoed for
// exactly the same reason the old `+m` was. Nothing new is assumed about how
// bahamut treats a voice grant to an existing op. It goes LAST — after it we
// are no longer op, so no further MODE would be applied.
//
// Anti-hollow-green: `/umode -i` in `finally` restores the shared seeded
// session's umode set so sibling specs do not inherit `+i` (mirrors #229).
//
// Desktop project (untagged → chromium; NO @webkit).
