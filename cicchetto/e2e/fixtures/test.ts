// Wrapped Playwright `test` fixture. Specs that need a grappa user MUST
// import `test` from THIS module instead of `@playwright/test`; the
// bare import gets no subject (admin-*, m9b-*, and the login-journey
// specs drive seeded users of their own on purpose).
//
// #1078 replaced what this fixture does. It used to run an afterEach
// that restored ONE shared user (`vjt`) to a baseline — drain nine
// enumerated surfaces, truncate and re-seed one enumerated channel.
// That can only clean what somebody remembered to enumerate, and the
// measurement on #1078 found what had fallen off the list: `$server`,
// the pseudo-channel the reset's own reconnect writes its notices into,
// grew +14 rows per reset and ~5000 across the suite.
//
// Now `_specSubject` PROVISIONS a whole subject before the body and
// destroys it after: its own user, its own credential, its own nick,
// its own seeded scrollback, its own session. Nothing carries to the
// next test because nothing is shared with it, and no list has to be
// kept current for that to stay true.
//
// Declared FIRST so it tears down LAST: deleting the user revokes its
// bearer and closes its socket, and that should happen after the CSP
// assertion and after the route drain, not in the middle of them.
//
// See `lib/grappa/test_support/subject_provision.ex` for the server
// half (compile-gated to dev/test Mix envs).

// `_cspGuard` (e2e CSP parity, 2026-06-11) — the BEAM emits the REAL
// prod Content-Security-Policy (GrappaWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders), and
// since #485 the e2e nginx is a dumb proxy that forwards it byte-for-byte
// (the header used to come from an nginx snippet; now grappa owns it),
// but a CSP-blocked resource only fails a spec if the spec happens to
// assert the blocked outcome. That's how the missing `media-src
// blob:` shipped (6f3327c): the blocked duration probe degraded the
// video upload to its capability fallback, the transcode-agnostic
// spec stayed green, and only prod dogfood saw it. This fixture
// closes the class: every page in the context registers a
// `securitypolicyviolation` listener (W3C CSP3 event, fires on the
// document for every enforced block) and the teardown asserts ZERO
// violations were collected. Any future directive regression turns
// every spec that exercises the blocked path red.
//
// Scope limits, both deliberate:
//   - document-context only: violations inside dedicated/service
//     workers don't bubble to any document. The 6f3327c worker-src
//     gap is still covered indirectly — the worker SPAWN from blob:
//     is a document-context violation; only blocks INSIDE an
//     already-running worker are invisible.
//   - wrapped-import specs only: bare `@playwright/test` specs
//     (admin-*, m9b-*) skip the guard, same as they get no per-spec
//     subject. The media/upload surfaces that motivated this all
//     import the wrapped `test`.
