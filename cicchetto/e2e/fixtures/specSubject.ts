// #1078 — one subject per test, instead of one subject for the suite.
//
// The suite used to share a single seeded user (`vjt`) and put it back
// to a baseline after every test: an enumerated list of surfaces to
// drain, plus a truncate-and-re-seed of an enumerated list of channels.
// A list only cleans what somebody remembered to put on it. #1078
// measured what fell off it — `$server`, the pseudo-channel the reset's
// own reconnect writes its notices into, grew +14 rows per reset and
// ~5000 across the suite, because it is not in the baseline.
//
// vjt ruled option (A): namespace by construction, at the SUBJECT
// level. `$server` is per-(user, network), so a per-channel namespace
// would not have closed it. Every surface the drain enumerated — read
// cursors, query windows, push subscriptions, settings, uploads, notify
// entries, WS presence, scrollback, the credential's channel lists — is
// keyed by `user_id`. A user created a millisecond ago is empty on all
// of them, including the ones nobody has thought of yet.
//
// Server half: `Grappa.TestSupport.SubjectProvision`, behind
// `POST /admin/test/subject` + `DELETE /admin/test/subject/:name`.

// (`auth_fsm.ex`) re-registers as `<nick>_` and then as two random
// suffixes, moving `state.nick` with it. Nothing raises; grappa even says
// so in the scrollback ("nick sbff5a028 was taken — you are registered as
// sbff5a028_"). Everything downstream that addressed the requested nick is
// then addressing somebody else.
//
// There is no product bug here to fix. `GET /networks` already answers the
// LIVE nick: `Networks.resolve_network_nick/2` asks the running
// Session.Server and falls back to the credential's configured nick only
// when no session is up, for exactly this reason — "a stale nick silently
// drops all inbound DMs" (`networks_controller.ex`). cic resolves its own
// nick from that row. This reads the same door instead of inventing a
// third semantics.
//
// 🔴 The hard constraint behind the two-shaped cure: JS has no synchronous
// fetch, so a synchronous accessor CANNOT be always-correct. It can only
// be made NOISY. Hence `specLiveNick()` (async, correct) where the nick is
// the stimulus, and the teardown guard in `fixtures/test.ts` (detection,
// zero spec edits) everywhere else.

// `connection` is the liveness discriminator, and it is the reason this
// returns a reading instead of a string: it is `null` exactly when
// `Session.connection_info/2` finds no live pid, which is exactly when
// `nick` is the CONFIGURED fallback rather than the flown value. Comparing
// a cached nick against a fallback would manufacture drift that isn't
// there, so "no live session" is reported as an absence of measurement,
// never as a nick.
