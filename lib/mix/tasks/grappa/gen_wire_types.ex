defmodule Mix.Tasks.Grappa.GenWireTypes do
  @shortdoc "Generate cicchetto/src/lib/wireTypes.ts from Grappa.*.Wire typespecs"

  @moduledoc """
  Walks every module under `lib/grappa/**/*wire.ex` (both the user-facing
  `wire.ex` modules and the operator-facing `admin_wire.ex` modules), parses
  `@type` declarations via Code.Typespec.fetch_types/1, emits a single
  deterministic TypeScript file at `cicchetto/src/lib/wireTypes.ts`.

  ## Usage

      mix grappa.gen_wire_types          # regenerate the file
      mix grappa.gen_wire_types --check  # exit 1 if committed file drifts

  ## Type mapping rules

  Standard Elixir scalars → TS scalars:

    * `String.t()` / `Ecto.UUID.t()` → `string`
    * `integer()` / `non_neg_integer()` / `pos_integer()` → `number`
    * `boolean()` → `boolean`
    * `nil` → `null`
    * atom literal `:foo` → string literal `"foo"`
    * atom union `:a | :b` → string union `"a" | "b"`
    * bare `atom()` → `string` (Jason serializes atoms as strings)
    * `[T]` → `T[]`
    * `T | nil` → `T | null`
    * nested `%{...}` → `{ ... }`
    * `required(:k) => T` (and `k: T` shorthand) → `k: T`
    * `optional(:k) => T` → `k?: T` (server may omit the key)
    * `DateTime.t()` → `string` (Jason → ISO-8601)
    * `term()` → `unknown`
    * bare `map()` → `Record<string, unknown>` (WARNING — defeats codegen purpose)

  Cross-module references resolve to a TS alias name (the type is
  emitted at its source module's section; the reference site just
  uses the alias).

  Pure atom-union `@type`s (and unions composing them) are ALSO emitted
  as `as const` arrays — see "Enum types" below.

  ## File shape

  Modules emitted in alphabetical order; types within a module in
  source order. Each module gets a `// === Grappa.X.Wire ===` header.
  When multiple `@type X_payload :: %{kind: :literal, ...}` exist in
  one module, codegen ALSO emits a `WireXEvent` discriminated union.

  ## Enum types → `as const` array + derived type (#411 D6b)

  A **(recursively-)enum** `@type` — a union whose every member is an
  atom literal (≠ `nil`/`true`/`false`) OR a same-module `user_type`
  ref to another enum — is emitted as a runtime `as const` array PLUS a
  type derived from it via `(typeof ARR)[number]`:

      export const REST_ERROR_TOKENS = [...SHARED_ERROR_TOKENS, "bad_request", …] as const;
      export type ErrorTokensRestErrorToken = (typeof REST_ERROR_TOKENS)[number];

  This collapses the three-parallel-structures problem in cicchetto's
  `friendly*Error.ts` (literal union + runtime narrowing `Set` +
  `switch`): the union and the `Set` now derive from ONE generated
  array. A composing enum SPREADS the referenced enum's const rather
  than re-inlining its literals (mirrors the Elixir `shared | specific`
  composition; the referenced const is emitted first because typedefs
  follow source order). The derived type is structurally identical to
  the old literal union, so consumers are unaffected. The const name is
  the SCREAMING_SNAKE of the type alias (1:1, so const + type can't
  drift). Two guards: **(a)** a cyclic ref RAISES with the type names in
  the cycle (never infinite recursion); **(b)** array element order is
  the declaration order (no sort/dedup) so regen output is stable and
  diffs don't flicker.

  # was a blind `String.replace/3` over the same three characters. Both halves
  # are wrong on the same inputs, in opposite directions: a body may carry
  # `" | "` without being a union (`Partial<Record<"a" | "b", T>>[]`, a nested
  # allowlisted-metadata bag), and a union arm may carry `" | "` without that
  # being an arm boundary (the same bag as one arm of a real union). The first
  # splits a type that has no arms; the second splits a real union INSIDE an
  # arm.
  #
  # What that actually costs, MEASURED with `tsc --noEmit` on the emitted text
  # rather than reasoned about, because the answer is not the obvious one and
  # #1466 left it open. Two regimes, and NEITHER is the "valid but wrong type"
  # the issue feared:
  #
  #   * `" | "` between TYPE tokens (both cases above): tsc exits 0 and the
  #     type is EXACTLY equivalent to the well-formatted one — newlines are
  #     insignificant and a leading `|` is legal, so the token stream is
  #     unchanged. The damage is pure FORMATTING, which is the worse of the two
  #     in practice: biome reflows it, so the codegen drift gate and the cic
  #     format gate disagree forever, with nothing failing loudly. That is the
  #     same collision that forced the `login_throttled` door/scope sets to be
  #     NAMED rather than inlined (DESIGN_NOTES 2026-08-06).
  #   * `" | "` inside a STRING LITERAL (an atom like `:"a | b"` in a mixed
  #     union): TS1002 "unterminated string literal". A hard syntax error the
  #     cic gate catches. No such atom exists in the wire today.
  #
  # The AST was two frames up the whole time — `pure_atom_union_arms/1` already
  # pattern-matches `{:|, _, _}` for exactly this question. The 100-column rule
  # is unchanged; what changed is what it is applied to.
  #
  # Residual, deliberately untouched: a NON-union body over 100 columns still
  # emits one long line (the `true ->` arm, as before), and so does an object
  # body with an over-long field (the `{` arm, which never wraps at all).
  # Wrapping an arbitrary TS construct the way biome does is a different job,
