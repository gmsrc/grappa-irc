defmodule Grappa.Net.ImageFetcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for fetching a theme background image BY URL (#75).

  Fetch-by-URL is the SSRF-exposed half of the background-image pipeline: a
  user-supplied URL that the SERVER dials. The real implementation
  (`Grappa.Net.ImageFetcher.Req`) resolves the host through
  `Grappa.Net.Ssrf` and connects to the *resolved* IP (rebind-safe), enforces a
  raster-only content-type allowlist, and caps the download size — never
  raising, always returning a tagged error.

  Isolating the network call behind a behaviour lets tests inject a
  deterministic mock (`Grappa.Net.ImageFetcherMock`, wired via
  `config :grappa, :themes, image_fetcher: …`) instead of standing up a real
  socket. `Grappa.Themes.BackgroundImage` resolves the configured module at
  runtime and calls `fetch/1`.

  ## Move history (M3b)

  Originally `Grappa.Themes.ImageFetcher` — relocated here so
  `Grappa.Avatars` (the M3b peer-avatar cache) could reuse this SAME
  SSRF-hardened fetch-by-URL behaviour for CTCP AVATAR URLs without
  creating a Boundary dependency cycle (`Session → Avatars → Themes →
  Networks → Session`, since `Grappa.Themes` itself depends on
  `Grappa.Networks`). "Fetch a raster image by URL, safely" is a
  network-safety primitive, not a themes concern — it belongs beside
  `Grappa.Net.Ssrf`, which it wraps. The config key stays under
  `:themes, :image_fetcher` (unchanged) rather than churning every
  caller's DI seam for a purely-cosmetic rename.
