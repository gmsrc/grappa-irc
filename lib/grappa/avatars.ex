defmodule Grappa.Avatars do
  @moduledoc """
  M3b — bouncer-wide, SSRF-hardened cache of a PEER's CTCP AVATAR image,
  per `(network, folded nick)`.

  ## Why this is a separate context from `Grappa.Uploads`

  A subject-owned permanent upload (`Grappa.Uploads`) and a best-effort
  cache of a fetched, untrusted stranger's image are different trust
  domains: one is content OUR user chose to publish (public, permanent,
  no expiry by default); the other is content a PEER claimed a URL for,
  fetched by US, on THEIR behalf, never to be treated as authoritative or
  permanent. CLAUDE.md: a shared data model with a type flag across two
  trust domains is a boundary violation, not reuse — hence a separate
  schema (`Grappa.Avatars.PeerAvatar`) even though the on-disk mechanics
  (slug filename under a storage root) mirror `Grappa.Uploads` closely.

  ## The fetch is never triggered by the browser

  `Grappa.Session.EventRouter` parses a peer's CTCP AVATAR reply and
  calls `fetch_and_cache/3` inside a detached `Grappa.TaskSupervisor`
  task — see that module's `maybe_query_avatar/2` / the AVATAR-reply
  parsing clause. The URL a peer supplies is fully untrusted; the
  browser NEVER sees it or fetches it directly (see
  `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md` #1280). `fetch_and_cache/3` is the entire SSRF
  boundary: scheme + SSRF-safe DNS resolution + no-redirect-follow (all
  three courtesy of reusing `Grappa.Net.ImageFetcher` — see below),
  a magic-byte content sniff on top of that, `Grappa.Uploads.
  MetadataStrip` for the same EXIF/GPS privacy reason a user's OWN
  upload gets stripped, and a disk-budget cap.

  ## Reusing `Grappa.Net.ImageFetcher`, deliberately

  "Fetch a raster image by URL, safely" is the SAME verb this app
  already built and hardened for the theme-background-image feature
  (#75): `Grappa.Net.Ssrf.resolve_safe/1` resolves the host once, DNS-
  rebind-safe (dials the resolved IP with `Host`/SNI still set to the
  original hostname), never follows a redirect (a second, unguarded hop
  would be an SSRF bypass — so refusing outright, not chasing a bounded
  number of hops, is the SAFER and simpler posture this module inherits
  rather than reinventing), and enforces a raster content-type allowlist
  + byte cap. Duplicating that as a second SSRF implementation for
  avatars would be exactly the "same problem, two solutions" CLAUDE.md
  rejects — this module calls the SAME configured module (`Application.
  compile_env(:grappa, [:themes, :image_fetcher], ...)`), so a test can
  swap in `Grappa.Net.ImageFetcherMock` for BOTH features with one
  seam. The one thing this module adds ON TOP, because a peer-declared
  URL is materially more adversarial than a URL an authenticated user
  pastes into their own theme picker: a magic-byte sniff of the
  downloaded bytes (`sniff_image_mime/1`), not just trusting the
  fetcher's already-allowlisted `Content-Type` header.

  ## Boundary

  Top-level. Deps: `Repo`, `Uploads` (MetadataStrip only — no schema
  dep), `Net.ImageFetcher`, `PubSub`. Deliberately NO `Networks` dep:
  `PeerAvatar.network_id` is a plain integer field, not a `belongs_to`
  association — `Grappa.Networks` already depends on `Grappa.Session`,
  and `Grappa.Session` depends on THIS module, so a `Networks` edge here
  would close a cycle (see `PeerAvatar`'s schema comment).
  `TaskSupervisor` is referenced by callers (`Session`), not by this
  module.

  Fetch `url` (a peer's CTCP AVATAR reply) for `(network_id, nick_key)`
  and, on success, cache the sanitized bytes. `nick_key` MUST already be
  folded (`Grappa.IRC.Identifier.canonical_target/1`) — this module does
  not fold, the caller (`EventRouter`) owns that per the codebase's
  nick-key invariant.

  Meant to run inside a detached `Task.Supervisor.start_child(Grappa.

  (it's a blocking HTTP round-trip). Every failure is swallowed (logged,
  not raised) — this is best-effort peer enrichment, never a
  user-facing error.

  On success, broadcasts `{:peer_avatar_ready, network_id, nick_key,
  slug}` on `Grappa.PubSub.Topic.peer_avatar_cache/1` so a live
  `Session.Server` can fold the result into its `peer_profile_cache`
