defmodule Grappa.Deploy.MigrationAudit do
  @moduledoc """
  Refuses to migrate past a version claimed by two files (#1348).

  ## The regime this exists for

  A duplicated migration version has three regimes, measured in Ecto's own
  source. On a fresh database it raises `Ecto.MigrationError` — loud, fine.
  On the hot preflight it dies on a `[path] = Path.wildcard(…)` match. And
  on a database that has **already applied** that version, both files drop
  out of the pending set, `ensure_no_duplication!([])` answers `:ok`, the
  run reports SUCCESS, and neither migration ever runs — permanently, since
  the version is already in `schema_migrations`.

  The third is the one production hits, and no count can see it: a pending
  count of zero is exactly what it produces, and exactly what a healthy
  deploy produces. So this compares version SETS, and the passing arm
  reports the counts it OBSERVED rather than announcing an absence of work.

  ## Why it does not live in `Grappa.Deploy.Preflight`

  Every substrate invokes the classifier with `mix run --no-start`, so
  `Preflight.cli/1` has no application started and no Repo — it cannot read
  `schema_migrations` at all. The gate therefore hangs off the doors that
  migrate, where a pool is live by construction: `check/1` for a caller that
  reports a refusal (the hot handler), `check!/1` for one whose refusal is a
  non-zero exit (`Grappa.Release.migrate/0`, `mix grappa.migrate`).

  ## The third column: reported, never refused

  A version in `schema_migrations` that no file on disk claims is reported
  and nothing more. It is a set DIFFERENCE — applied versions minus the
  versions the directory carries — so nothing here reads the
  `"** FILE NOT FOUND **"` placeholder `Ecto.Migrator.collect_migrations/2`
  writes for such a row; a gate coupled to another project's internal
  string goes silently to zero the day that string changes.

  It does not refuse because a database ahead of the code is also a
  legitimate rollback, and a deploy from an older checkout: refusing there
  would block a valid operation at every door. It is not silent because
  staying silent is what turned one foreign migration in a shared test
  database into three unrelated tests raising on an index nobody declared
  (2026-08-15). See DESIGN_NOTES 2026-08-16.

  The rule, over a merged `Ecto.Migrator.migrations/1` table and the

  `{:ok, summary}` when no version is claimed twice, `{:error, duplicates}`
  otherwise — oldest version first, and each duplicate's files sorted, so
  the refusal reads the same regardless of the order Ecto handed the rows
  over (it reverses the applied ones).

  `disk_versions` is a second OBSERVATION, not a derivation: the merged
  table cannot be split back into its two sides without reading the
  placeholder name Ecto writes for a fileless version, and coupling to
  another project's internal string is what this module refuses to do.
