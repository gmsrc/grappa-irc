defmodule Grappa.Session.ISupport do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-network capability table, parsed from the upstream's 005
  RPL_ISUPPORT tokens: `CHANMODES=`, `PREFIX=`, `STATUSMSG=`,
  `CASEMAPPING=`, `MONITOR=`/`WATCH=`, since #1255 `CHANTYPES=`,
  `MAXLIST=`, `NICKLEN=`, `CHANNELLEN=` and `TOPICLEN=`, and — since
  #1390 — `MODES=` and `LINELEN=`, the last two that `Session.Server`
  still scanned for itself under a merge rule of their own.

  ## Why this exists

  Two facts about a channel mode letter are network-specific and MUST come
  from the server, not a hardcoded guess:

    1. **Does it consume an argument?** `+k secret` and `+l 42` carry a
       param; `+n`/`+t`/`+s` do not. Getting this wrong misaligns the
       argument list for every mode after it in a multi-mode line.
    2. **Is it a membership (per-user) mode?** `+o alice` / `+v bob`
       decorate a *member* (→ `@`/`+` sigils), while `+b mask` /
       `+k key` decorate the *channel*. The set of membership modes and
       their rendered sigils comes from `PREFIX=`.

  Before #216 both facts were hardcoded compile-time constants in
  `Grappa.Session.EventRouter` (`@user_mode_prefixes`,
  `@channel_modes_with_param`), flagged "deferred to Phase 5". This module
  is that Phase-5 lift: the server parses CHANMODES + PREFIX at 005 and
  every consumer — the member-map walker, the channel_modes-cache walker,
  and the cic `/mode` modal (via a broadcast) — reads ONE capability
  table. `default/0` carries the exact values the old constants held, so a
  session that never sees a 005 (or a server that omits the tokens)
  behaves identically to before.

  ## CHANMODES classes (RFC 2811 §4.3, ISUPPORT `CHANMODES=A,B,C,D`)

    * **Type A** (list modes: `b`,`e`,`I`) — always take a param (add
      AND remove).
    * **Type B** (always-param: `k`) — take a param on both `+` and `-`.
    * **Type C** (set-only-param: `l`) — take a param on `+`, none on `-`.
    * **Type D** (flag modes: `n`,`t`,`m`,`s`,`i`,`p`,…) — never take a
      param.

  Membership modes (from `PREFIX`) are handled separately: they always
  consume a param (the target nick) regardless of sign, and are excluded
  from the CHANMODES classes.

  This is a stateless module — no GenServer, no Repo, no PubSub. The lone
  side effect is a diagnostic `Logger.warning` when a 005 advertises a
  `CASEMAPPING=` value we do not model (#537); parsing itself is pure.
  `Grappa.Session.Server` holds one `t()` per session on its state and
  threads it into `EventRouter` at route time.

  IRCv3 listener facade translates from when it has to EMIT a 005
  downstream. One 005, two readers, no second parse.

  Two boundaries, both load-bearing:

    * It NEVER goes on the cic wire. Design principle #1 is "no IRC
      parsing in the web client"; a bag of verbatim tokens shipped to
      cicchetto is IRC protocol re-entering through the window. The client
      gets the TYPED widening instead.
    * The facade must TRANSLATE, not passthrough. `NETWORK`, `MODES`,
      `TARGMAX` and `LINELEN` describe the upstream ircd and the upstream
      path; a downstream client is talking to grappa, whose framing budget
      (#246/#1108), chunking and target limits are its own. This map is
      the INPUT to that translation, never its output.
