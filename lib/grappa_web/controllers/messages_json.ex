  Phoenix view layer for `Grappa.Scrollback.Message` rows.

  Thin web-layer adapter: `index/1` and `show/1` follow Phoenix's
  render-function naming convention and delegate to
  `Grappa.Scrollback.Wire.to_json/1` — the single source of truth for
  the public JSON wire shape.

  Per CLAUDE.md "no leaky abstractions: each context owns its
  domain. Return domain types" — wire shape is a domain concern (the
  same shape ships over REST, PubSub broadcasts, Phoenix Channel
  pushes, and the eventual Phase 6 IRCv3 `CHATHISTORY` listener
  facade). It lives in `Grappa.Scrollback.Wire`, not here.

  Renders the `:show` action — a single serialized message map.

  Takes the network slug explicitly (#1657b). `:show` renders a row that
  was JUST persisted, and the persist boundary no longer preloads
  `:network` — so this is `to_json/2`, while `index/1` above stays on
  `to_json/1` because its rows come out of a query that preloaded.

  @doc """
  Renders the `:count` action (#693) — the uncapped row count after an
  anchor. An object rather than a bare integer so the shape stays
  additive: a future sibling figure (say, a tail id) is a new key, not a
  breaking change of the response type. #2037 is that future arriving.

  ## Three numbers, because the route answers TWO questions (#2037)

  `count` is the THRESHOLD's feed and is unchanged from #693: raw rows a
  `?after=` page would return, own-authored included. cic's
  `isFarBehind(gap)` asks "is contiguous paging achievable", which is a
  question about rows on the wire, and the #2037 ruling puts it out of
  scope explicitly.

  `messages` + `events` are the DISPLAY split — the same
  `@content_kinds`-vs-rest partition `ReadCursor.bulk_unread_split/3`
  seeds the sidebar pills with. The far-behind bar renders `messages`,
  so the bar and the bold pill are the same quantity rather than two
  opinions about one.

  All three come from ONE `resolve_hide_presence/3` in the caller, so
  the split can never be resolved on a different presence posture than
  the count — which is precisely the divergence #2037 measured between
  the two `PresenceFilter.Resolver` doors.

  ## ONE number, when the caller asked only the threshold (issue 2282)

  `split: nil` is the `?cap=` mode and renders `{"count": N}` alone. The
  missing keys are not an omission to paper over with zeros: zero is a
  perfectly good answer to "how many messages" and the caller would have no
  way to tell it from "not asked". A `cap` caller holds its own cap, so
  `count == cap` is all it needs to read "at least cap".

  The two shapes are separate CLAUSES rather than one clause with a
  conditional merge, so a `split` that is neither a `count_split()` nor
  `nil` is a FunctionClauseError here instead of a body missing keys the
  client requires.
