  @moduledoc """
  Channel-tree read surface (`index/2`) + upstream JOIN / PART / TOPIC
  (`create/2` + `delete/2` + `topic/2`) for the per-(subject, network)
  session.

  Subject-dispatched (Task 30): every action reads `:current_subject`
  from `conn.assigns` (plumbed by `Plugs.Authn`) — a tagged tuple
  `{:user, %User{}} | {:visitor, %Visitor{}}` carrying the loaded
  struct (M-web-1). The `Grappa.Session.send_*` API speaks the leaner
  ID-tuple shape (`{:user, id} | {:visitor, id}`); the conversion
  goes through `GrappaWeb.Subject.to_session/1`. The URL `:network_id`
  slug → schema struct resolution + per-subject iso check happens in
  `GrappaWeb.Plugs.ResolveNetwork`; this controller reads
  `conn.assigns.network` and never re-resolves.

  ## index

  `GET /networks/:network_id/channels` returns the union of the
  subject's autojoin source (user → `Credential.autojoin_channels`,
  visitor → `Visitors.list_autojoin_channels/1`) and the live
  session-tracked channel set (`Grappa.Session.list_channels/2`).
  Wire shape per channel: `%{name, joined, source}` where `:source`
  is `:autojoin` for autojoin-declared entries (winner on overlap,
  Q3 pin) and `:joined` for dynamically-joined-only entries.

  Per-subject iso is enforced by `Plugs.ResolveNetwork` upstream —
  visitor's `network_slug` mismatch and user's missing-credential
  both surface as the same uniform `404 {"error": "not_found"}` body
  so probers cannot distinguish.

  ## create / delete / topic

  All require an active session for the network — without one,
  `Grappa.Session.send_*` returns `{:error, :no_session}` which the
  `FallbackController` maps to a uniform 404 `{"error": "not_found"}`
  (CP10 S14 oracle close). Persistence of JOIN/PART events into
  scrollback lands in Phase 5.

  `POST /networks/:network_id/channels` — body `{"name": "#chan"}` or

  support). Calls through to `Session.send_join/4`, which writes
  `window_states[ch] = :pending` AND broadcasts `window_pending` on the
  user-level PubSub topic before returning. cic's setPending dispatch
  has fired (and the synthetic sidebar pseudo-row has rendered) by the
  time this returns 202 + `{"ok": true}`.

  #382 — `name` accepts the RFC1459 comma-separated channel LIST
  (`"#a,#b,#c"`); `validate_channel_list/1` requires EVERY element to be
  a valid channel (a malformed member fails the WHOLE request with 400,
  no partial JOIN) and `Session.send_join/4` forwards ONE multi-target
  JOIN line + opens a `:pending` window per channel. A single channel is
  a list-of-one, so the single-channel body is unchanged. Key-list
  (`JOIN #a,#b k1,k2`) is out of scope: a single `key` applies to the
  whole multi-join.

  The key (when present) is forwarded to the upstream JOIN frame as
  the +k channel key. It is NOT persisted to autojoin and NOT logged
  in scrollback. A wrong/missing key surfaces server-side as 475
  ERR_BADCHANNELKEY through the existing join-failure pipeline →
  `:join_failed` event with numeric=475 → cic surfaces the failure
