defmodule GrappaWeb.UserSocket do
  @moduledoc """
  WebSocket entry point at `/socket/websocket`.

  Sub-task 2h roots every Grappa topic in the user discriminator
  (`grappa:user:{name}/...`); the legacy Phase 1 `grappa:network:*`
  route is gone — any client subscribing on that prefix would not
  resolve to a channel module and Phoenix returns the standard
  unknown-topic error. `grappa:user:*` is the only routed prefix
  because join semantics differ only in topic shape, not in behavior;
  `GrappaWeb.GrappaChannel` does the topic discrimination + per-subject
  authz on join.

  ## Connect-time auth (sub-task 2i + visitor-auth Task 12 + #95 + #202)

  `connect/3` verifies a bearer token against
  `Grappa.Accounts.authenticate/1` — same UUID PK that the REST
  surface consumes via `Authorization: Bearer ...`. The bearer's ONLY
  source is the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol (#95): it rides the
  WS handshake's subprotocol as `base64url.bearer.phx.<token>`, which
  Phoenix's websocket transport decodes into `connect_info.auth_token`
  (`auth_token: true` in `endpoint.ex`). This keeps the token OFF the WS
  upgrade URL (`?token=…`, which was pre-redaction visible in access
  logs).

  #95 also retained the legacy `params["token"]` query-string bearer as
  a one-deploy-cycle fallback so a stale bundle mid-cold-deploy still
  connected; #202 dropped it once prod telemetry showed sustained zero
  query-string auth. A bearer supplied via the query string is now
  ignored entirely — the token's ONLY source is the subprotocol.

  ## Protocol-version handshake (#447)

  `connect/3` runs a pre-auth protocol-version gate BEFORE auth. A client
  MAY declare the wire protocol version it speaks via the `client_proto`
  QUERY PARAM (`connect/3`'s `params` — no longer unused). Query param, not
  subprotocol, because the version is PUBLIC discovery data (also at
  `GET /api/config`), not a credential: the #95/#202 off-the-URL rule
  applies only to the secret bearer, which keeps riding the subprotocol
  exclusively — so the two channels stay orthogonal and never collide
  (DESIGN_NOTES 2026-07-27).

  A client declaring below `Grappa.Protocol.min_version/0` is refused with
  `{:error, :upgrade_required}`, which the endpoint's custom `error_handler`
  (`handle_ws_error/2`) turns into a clean `426 Upgrade Required` — NOT an
  accepted socket fed frames it will mangle, and NOT the opaque 403 an auth
  failure gets. Absent or unparseable → treated as current, so existing
  clients keep working untouched.

  Every authenticated connect emits a `[:grappa, :ws, :connect]`
  telemetry counter (`%{count: 1}`, empty metadata) + a greppable Logger
  line — a cheap ops signal for connect churn. Neither carries the token
  value (the raw bearer IS the session credential — S9). #95's
  `auth_method` tag is gone (#202): once the query-string fallback was
  removed it collapsed to a constant `:subprotocol`.

  The authenticated `Session` row carries an XOR FK (`user_id` xor
  `visitor_id`, per Q-A). `connect/3` dispatches on that XOR:

    * **User session** — assigns `:user_name = user.name` (from the
      User row).
    * **Visitor session** — assigns
      `:user_name = "visitor:" <> visitor.id` mirroring
      `Visitors.SessionPlan.build/1`'s `subject_label` rule (Q1=a)
      so `Session.Server`'s broadcasts under
      `Topic.channel("visitor:" <> visitor.id, ...)` route to the
      same value the channel-side authz check uses. Also assigns
      `:current_visitor_id` and `:current_visitor` for downstream
      channel handlers. The branch runs `Visitors.touch/1` for the
      W9 sliding-TTL refresh — visitor activity over the WS surface
      counts as user-initiated traffic, same as Plugs.Authn for REST.

  Both branches assign `:current_session_id` (for future revocation
  hooks) at the connect boundary AND `:current_subject` — the bare-id
  `Grappa.Subject.t()` tuple (`{:user, uuid}` or `{:visitor, uuid}`)
  consumed directly by channel arms that hit subject-scoped contexts
  (UserSettings, ReadCursor, QueryWindows, Push). Mirror of the
  controller-side `Subject.from_assigns/1` lift — V4 visitor-parity
  (2026-05-15).

  Both branches also assign `:socket_ref` (#1088) — a per-CONNECTION
  reference, distinct from every subject-level identifier on the socket,
  used to address an informational reply back to the client that asked
  for it instead of fanning it out to every device of the subject.

  Any failure (missing / empty subprotocol token, malformed UUID,
  unknown row, revoked, expired user session, expired or vanished
  visitor) returns `:error`
  — Phoenix surfaces the WS rejection with no body; distinct error
  strings would just leak enumeration info on what went wrong with
  the token.

  (the id-topic label `assign_subject/2` installs — `user.name` for a
  user, `"visitor:" <> id` for a visitor). The WS-layer twin of
  `disconnect_subject/1` for callers that hold the `user_name` (the
  channel socket assign) but not the struct subject — GH #630's flood
  sever runs inside `GrappaChannel.handle_in`, where only `user_name` is
  in scope. Both go through the SAME id-topic broadcast so there is ONE
  socket-teardown code path.

  Fire-and-forget: a PubSub-server-unreachable `{:error, _}` is logged and
  swallowed (the caller has already revoked the session, so the socket is
  rejected on its next connect anyway).

  Close the live WebSocket(s) carrying ONE bearer session, leaving every
  other socket of the same subject serving (#1499).

  The narrow twin of `disconnect_user_name/1`, for the doors that kill a
  single row rather than an account: the idle-session reaper is the
  first, and it is the one that made the difference visible, because it
  fires on a timer with nobody behind it. Same id-topic broadcast, a
  different address — one teardown code path, two granularities.

  Usually one socket, not necessarily: two transports opened with the
  same bearer share the session and both go down, which is correct —
  the row under them is what died.

  Fire-and-forget on the same terms as `disconnect_user_name/1`.
