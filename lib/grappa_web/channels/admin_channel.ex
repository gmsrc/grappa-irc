defmodule GrappaWeb.AdminChannel do
  @moduledoc """
  Phoenix Channel for `Grappa.PubSub.Topic.admin_events/0` —
  `"grappa:admin:events"` (M-cluster M-11).

  ## Authz

  Single shape passes: `socket.assigns.is_admin == true`. This is the
  WS sibling of `GrappaWeb.Admin.AuthPlug`'s `is_admin` gate on
  `conn.assigns.current_subject`. The two surfaces share one invariant
  ("admin = `is_admin: true` on the User row"); the shape difference
  is just the carrier (struct on HTTP, bare-id tuple + sibling assign
  on WS — see `UserSocket.assign_subject/2` rationale for keeping the
  `current_subject` tuple bare-id per V4 visitor-parity).

  Visitor subjects + non-admin user subjects + missing `is_admin`
  assign collapse to `{:error, %{error: "forbidden"}}`.

  ## Snapshot on join

  After-join push delivers the in-memory ring buffer (newest-first)
  as a `"snapshot"` event via `push/3`. Mirror of
  `GrappaChannel.push_user_snapshot/2` — cold-WS-subscribe parity so
  the Events tab populates immediately on first open (no flicker).

  ## Session-lifecycle log live push (#215)

  On join the channel ALSO subscribes to `Topic.session_log/0`
  (`"grappa:session_log"`) — a DIFFERENT topic from the channel's own
  joined topic, so the sink's `%Phoenix.Socket.Broadcast{}` arrives via
  `handle_info/2` (not the fastlane) and is re-pushed as a
  `"session_log_event"`. The snapshot for this surface is the REST door
  (`GET /admin/session_log`), which cic fetches on tab mount; the channel
  carries only live updates. Reuses the admin socket rather than a second
  channel (Option B: two persisted admin surfaces, one operator socket).

  ## Nothing unknown is fatal, in either direction (#1407 W-S7)

  Neither an unrecognised inbound frame nor an unrecognised mailbox
  message takes the operator's console down: both collapse to a
  catch-all, and the `handle_info/2` one logs at warning so the message
  it cannot read stays visible. See that clause for why crashing would
  surface less, not more.

  ## No inbound handlers

  Admin events are server-originated only. The single `handle_in/3`
  clause below pattern-matches everything and replies `:ok` so the
  framework doesn't crash on an unexpected client push. A future
  operator action driven from the admin tab (e.g. "clear events
  buffer") would land as a controller endpoint, not a channel
  inbound — admin REST is the existing mutation surface.

  ## Test isolation

  Tests touching this channel MUST be `async: false` because
  `Grappa.AdminEvents` is a singleton (registered as `__MODULE__`).
  Channel-level tests subscribe to `Topic.admin_events/0` directly
  for assertions; AdminEvents itself runs once for the whole suite.

  # per-MESSAGE and stateless, so a crash cannot retry the unread message

  # events down with it, and a repeating publisher then walks the restart
  # intensity until the operator's console is gone for good.
