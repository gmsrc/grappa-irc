defmodule GrappaWeb.Endpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Phoenix endpoint — HTTP + WebSocket entry point under Bandit.

  Pipeline order matters: `RequestId` runs first so every downstream
  log line carries `[request_id]`; `Telemetry` straddles `Parsers` so
  request duration includes body decoding; `MethodOverride` runs
  after `Parsers` because it reads `_method` from the parsed body;
  `Plug.Head` lets HEAD share GET routes; `Session` runs before the
  router so handlers can call `get_session/2`.

  ## Session signing-salt runtime resolution (REV-C / H21)

  `signing_salt` is read at RUNTIME from `:grappa,
  GrappaWeb.Endpoint, :session_signing_salt`. Pre-REV-C the value was
  read at COMPILE time via `Application.compile_env!/2`, which baked
  the build-time `SECRET_SIGNING_SALT` env value into the prod
  release; an operator rotating the salt via `.env` + auto-deploy
  saw no effect until the image was rebuilt with a fresh `mix
  compile`. H21 moves the read to `config/runtime.exs` alongside
  `SECRET_KEY_BASE` so rotation works the same way as the sibling
  key — bump value, COLD-deploy, salt picks up at boot.

  The runtime read is cached in `:persistent_term` on first request
  (lazy init in the `session/2` plug). Subsequent requests are
  lock-free reads. Per CLAUDE.md "Application.{put,get}_env: boot-
  time only" — this is the boundary site for the keyspace; the rest
  of the codebase never sees the raw env value. First-request races
  are benign (multiple writers, same value).

  WebSocket transport at `/socket/websocket` is the only streaming
  surface. No longpoll fallback — Phase 1 clients are evergreen
  browsers, and the Phase 6 IRCv3 listener facade will need full
  WS framing anyway.

  # became the sole origin (nginx demoted to a dumb proxy) the PWA manifest

  # the #485 icons above and it would have been QUIETER: #1739 also removed the
  # `onError` fallback from the picker's `<img>` (a same-origin asset the
  # offline gate proves is present cannot fail the way a third-party URL
  # could), so a logo arriving as `index.html` draws the browser's broken glyph

  # #95 — accept the bearer via the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol
  # (`auth_token: true`) so it no longer has to ride `?token=` on the WS
  # upgrade URL (pre-redaction URL exposure). Phoenix decodes the
  # `base64url.bearer.phx.<token>` subprotocol into
  # `connect_info.auth_token` and echoes the selected subprotocol back on
  # the handshake; phoenix.js sends it via `new Socket(ep, {authToken})`.
  # `auth_token: true` MUST be a TOP-LEVEL socket option, NOT nested
  # under `websocket:` — `Phoenix.Endpoint`'s `put_auth_token/2` reads
  # `opts[:auth_token]` (the socket-level key) and merges it into the
  # transport config itself; nesting it under `websocket:` leaves
  # `opts[:auth_token]` nil, silently disables decoding, and every
  # subprotocol handshake 403s (found via e2e — the WS refused in ~11µs
  # because `connect_info.auth_token` was never populated). `connect_info:
  # [:auth_token]` on the websocket transport then surfaces the decoded
  # token to `UserSocket.connect/3`.
  #
  # #202 dropped the legacy `params["token"]` query-string path that #95
  # had retained as a one-deploy-cycle fallback: with prod telemetry
  # showing sustained zero query-string auth, the subprotocol is now the
  # SOLE bearer source and the token never rides the WS upgrade URL.
  # #447 — a custom `error_handler` turns a `{:error, :upgrade_required}`
  # return from `UserSocket.connect/3` (a client declaring a wire protocol
  # below `Grappa.Protocol.min_version/0` via the `?client_proto=` query
  # param) into a clean `426 Upgrade Required` instead of the transport's
  # default opaque 403. `Phoenix.Socket.Transport.load_config/2` merges
  # `websocket:` opts OVER the transport's `default_config/0`, so this key
  # overrides the default `{Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket, :handle_error}`.
  # It fires ONLY for `{:error, reason}` returns; a bare `:error` (auth
  # failure) still gets the default 403, keeping the two failures distinct.
  # #543 Part C — `:peer_data` (transport peer IP) + `:x_headers` (the
  # forwarded `x-*` request headers) are surfaced to `UserSocket.connect/3`
  # so it can resolve the TRUSTED client IP (via the `RemoteIpFromProxy`
  # SSOT) and feed it to `Vhosts.record_client_source/2`. A WS `connect/3`
  # gets `connect_info` (a map built ONLY from the declared keys), NOT a
  # `Plug.Conn`, so the `RemoteIpFromProxy` PLUG above never runs for the
  # socket — these keys are the socket's only path to the client IP. Additive
  # to `:auth_token`; ordering of the other socket opts is untouched.
